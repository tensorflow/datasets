# `coil100`

The dataset contains 7200 color images of 100 objects (72 images per object).
The objects have a wide variety of complex geometric and reflectance
characteristics. The objects were placed on a motorized turntable against a
black background. The turntable was rotated through 360 degrees to vary object
pose with respect to a fxed color camera. Images of the objects were taken at
pose intervals of 5 degrees.This corresponds to 72 poses per object
