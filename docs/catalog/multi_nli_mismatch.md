# `multi_nli_mismatch`

The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced
collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information.
The corpus is modeled on the SNLI corpus, but differs in that covers a range of
genres of spoken and written text, and supports a distinctive cross-genre
generalization evaluation. The corpus served as the basis for the shared task of
the RepEval 2017 Workshop at EMNLP in Copenhagen.
