# `iris`

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition
literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced
frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3
classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly
separable from each other.
