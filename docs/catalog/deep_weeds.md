# `deep_weeds`

The DeepWeeds dataset consists of 17,509 images capturing eight different weed
species native to Australia in situ with neighbouring flora.The selected weed
species are local to pastoral grasslands across the state of Queensland.The
images were collected from weed infestations at the following sites across
Queensland: "Black River", "Charters Towers", "Cluden", "Douglas", "Hervey
Range", "Kelso", "McKinlay" and "Paluma".
