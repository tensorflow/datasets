# `yelp_polarity_reviews`

*   **Description**:

Large Yelp Review Dataset. This is a dataset for binary sentiment
classification. We provide a set of 560,000 highly polar yelp reviews for
training, and 38,000 for testing. ORIGIN The Yelp reviews dataset consists of
reviews from Yelp. It is extracted from the Yelp Dataset Challenge 2015 data.
For more information, please refer to http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge

The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang
(xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset. It is first used as a text
classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann
LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances
in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

DESCRIPTION

The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by considering stars 1 and 2
negative, and 3 and 4 positive. For each polarity 280,000 training samples and
19,000 testing samples are take randomly. In total there are 560,000 trainig
samples and 38,000 testing samples. Negative polarity is class 1, and positive
class 2.

The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training samples as
comma-sparated values. There are 2 columns in them, corresponding to class index
(1 and 2) and review text. The review texts are escaped using double quotes ("),
and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are
escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is " ".
