Warning: Manual download required. See instructions below.

*   **Description**:

Procedurally Generated Matrices (PGM) data from the paper Measuring Abstract
Reasoning in Neural Networks, Barrett, Hill, Santoro et al. 2018. The goal is to
infer the correct answer from the context panels based on abstract reasoning.

To use this data set, please download all the *.tar.gz files from the data set
page and place them in ~/tensorflow_datasets/abstract_reasoning/.

$R$ denotes the set of relation types (progression, XOR, OR, AND, consistent
union), $O$ denotes the object types (shape, line), and $A$ denotes the
attribute types (size, colour, position, number). The structure of a matrix,
$S$, is the set of triples $S={[r, o, a]}$ that determine the challenge posed by
a particular matrix.

## abstract_reasoning/neutral (default config)

*   **Config description**: The structures encoding the matrices in both the \
    training and testing sets contain any triples $[r, o, a]$ for $r \\in R$, \
    $o \\in O$, and $a \\in A$. Training and testing sets are disjoint, with \
    separation occurring at the level of the input variables (i.e. pixel \
    manifestations).

## abstract_reasoning/interpolation

*   **Config description**: As in the neutral split, $S$ consisted of any \
    triples $[r, o, a]$. For interpolation, in the training set, when the \
    attribute was "colour" or "size" (i.e., the ordered attributes), the values
    of \
    the attributes were restricted to even-indexed members of a discrete set, \
    whereas in the test set only odd-indexed values were permitted. Note that
    all \
    $S$ contained some triple $[r, o, a]$ with the colour or size attribute . \
    Thus, generalisation is required for every question in the test set.

## abstract_reasoning/extrapolation

*   **Config description**: Same as in interpolation, but the values of \
    the attributes were restricted to the lower half of the discrete set during
    \
    training, whereas in the test set they took values in the upper half.

## abstract_reasoning/attr.rel.pairs

*   **Config description**: All $S$ contained at least two triples, \
    $([r_1,o_1,a_1],[r_2,o_2,a_2]) = (t_1, t_2)$, of which 400 are viable. We \
    randomly allocated 360 to the training set and 40 to the test set. Members \
    $(t_1, t_2)$ of the 40 held-out pairs did not occur together in structures
    $S$ \
    in the training set, and all structures $S$ had at least one such pair \
    $(t_1, t_2)$ as a subset.

## abstract_reasoning/attr.rels

*   **Config description**: In our dataset, there are 29 possible unique \
    triples $[r,o,a]$. We allocated seven of these for the test set, at random,
    \
    but such that each of the attributes was represented exactly once in this
    set. \
    These held-out triples never occurred in questions in the training set, and
    \
    every $S$ in the test set contained at least one of them.

## abstract_reasoning/attrs.pairs

*   **Config description**: $S$ contained at least two triples. There are 20 \
    (unordered) viable pairs of attributes $(a_1, a_2)$ such that for some \
    $r_i, o_i, ([r_1,o_1,a_1],[r_2,o_2,a_2])$ is a viable triple pair \
    $([r_1,o_1,a_1],[r_2,o_2,a_2]) = (t_1, t_2)$. We allocated 16 of these pairs
    \
    for training and four for testing. For a pair $(a_1, a_2)$ in the test set,
    \
    $S$ in the training set contained triples with $a_1$ or $a_2$. In the test \
    set, all $S$ contained triples with $a_1$ and $a_2$.

## abstract_reasoning/attrs.shape.color

*   **Config description**: Held-out attribute shape-colour. $S$ in \
    the training set contained no triples with $o$=shape and $a$=colour. \
    All structures governing puzzles in the test set contained at least one
    triple \
    with $o$=shape and $a$=colour.

## abstract_reasoning/attrs.line.type

*   **Config description**: Held-out attribute line-type. $S$ in \
    the training set contained no triples with $o$=line and $a$=type. \
    All structures governing puzzles in the test set contained at least one
    triple \
    with $o$=line and $a$=type.
