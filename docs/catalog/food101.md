*   **Description**:

This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each
class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training
images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain
some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and
sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length
of 512 pixels.
