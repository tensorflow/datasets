# `imagenet2012`

ILSVRC 2012, aka ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet
hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple
words or word phrases, is called a "synonym set" or "synset". There are more
than 100,000 synsets in WordNet, majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In
ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset.
Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its
completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted
images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.
