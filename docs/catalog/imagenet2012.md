# `imagenet2012` (Manual download)

ILSVRC 2012, aka ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet
hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple
words or word phrases, is called a "synonym set" or "synset". There are more
than 100,000 synsets in WordNet, majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In
ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset.
Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its
completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted
images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.

Note that labels were never publicly released for the test set, so we only
include splits for the training and validation sets here.

    [`tfds.image.imagenet.Imagenet2012`](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/tree/master/tensorflow_datasets/image/imagenet.py)
*   Version: `v2.0.1`
*   Versions:

WARNING: This dataset requires you to download the source data manually into
manual_dir (defaults to `~/tensorflow_datasets/manual/imagenet2012/`):
manual_dir should contain two files: ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar and
ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar. You need to register on
http://www.image-net.org/download-images in order to get the link to download
the dataset.
