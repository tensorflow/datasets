Warning: Manual download required. See instructions below.

*   **Description**:

CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest
x-ray interpretation, which features uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled
reference standard evaluation sets. It consists of 224,316 chest radiographs of
65,240 patients, where the chest radiographic examinations and the associated
radiology reports were retrospectively collected from Stanford Hospital. Each
report was labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or
uncertain. We decided on the 14 observations based on the prevalence in the
reports and clinical relevance.

The CheXpert dataset must be downloaded separately after reading and agreeing to
a Research Use Agreement. To do so, please follow the instructions on the
website, https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/.

    *   **`3.1.0`** (default): No release notes.

*   **Download size**: `Unknown size`

*   **Dataset size**: `Unknown size`

*   **Manual download instructions**: This dataset requires you to
    download the source data manually into `download_config.manual_dir`
    (defaults to `~/tensorflow_datasets/downloads/manual/`):<br/>
    You must register and agree to user agreement on the dataset page:
    https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/
    Afterwards, you have to put the CheXpert-v1.0-small directory in the
    manual_dir. It should contain subdirectories: train/ and valid/ with images
    and also train.csv and valid.csv files.
