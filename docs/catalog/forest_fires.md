# `forest_fires`

*   **Description**:

This is a regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest
fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other
data.

Data Set Information:

In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a
ln(x+1) function. Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting
the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1)
transform. Four different input setups were used. The experiments were conducted
using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two regression metrics were
measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed with only 4
direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student
distribution). The best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An
analysis to the regression error curve (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts
more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the SVM model predicts
better small fires, which are the majority.

Attribute Information:

For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007].

1.  X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
2.  Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
3.  month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
4.  day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
5.  FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
6.  DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
7.  DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
8.  ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
9.  temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 (this output
    variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make sense to model with
    the logarithm transform).
