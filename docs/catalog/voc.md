## voc/2007 (default config)

*   **Description**:

This dataset contains the data from the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge
2007, a.k.a. VOC2007, corresponding to the Classification and Detection
competitions. A total of 9963 images are included in this dataset, where each
image contains a set of objects, out of 20 different classes, making a total of
24640 annotated objects. In the Classification competition, the goal is to
predict the set of labels contained in the image, while in the Detection
competition the goal is to predict the bounding box and label of each individual
object. WARNING: As per the official dataset, the test set of VOC2012 does not
contain annotations.
