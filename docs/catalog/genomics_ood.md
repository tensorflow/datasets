# `genomics_ood`

*   **Description**:

Bacteria identification based on genomic sequences holds the promise of early
detection of diseases, but requires a model that can output low confidence
predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) genomic sequences from new bacteria
that were not present in the training data.

We introduce a genomics dataset for OOD detection that allows other researchers
to benchmark progress on this important problem. New bacterial classes are
gradually discovered over the years. Grouping classes by years is a natural way
to mimic the in-distribution and OOD examples.

The dataset contains genomic sequences sampled from 10 bacteria classes that
were discovered before the year 2011 as in-distribution classes, 60 bacteria
classes discovered between 2011-2016 as OOD for validation, and another 60
different bacteria classes discovered after 2016 as OOD for test, in total 130
bacteria classes. Note that training, validation, and test data are provided for
the in-distribution classes, and validation and test data are proviede for OOD
classes. By its nature, OOD data is not available at the training time.

The genomic sequence is 250 long, composed by characters of {A, C, G, T}. The
sample size of each class is 100,000 in the training and 10,000 for the
validation and test sets.

For each example, the features include:
  seq: the input DNA sequence composed by {A, C, G, T}.
  label: the name of the bacteria class.
  seq_info: the source of the DNA sequence, i.e., the genome name, NCBI
  accession number, and the position where it was sampled from.
  domain: if the bacteria is in-distribution (in), or OOD (ood)

The details of the dataset can be found in the paper supplemental.
