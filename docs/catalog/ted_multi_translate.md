# `ted_multi_translate`

Massively multilingual (60 language) data set derived from TED Talk transcripts.
Each record consists of parallel arrays of language and text. Missing and
incomplete translations will be filtered out.

*   URL:
    [https://github.com/neulab/word-embeddings-for-nmt](https://github.com/neulab/word-embeddings-for-nmt)
*   `DatasetBuilder`:
    [`tfds.translate.ted_multi.TedMultiTranslate`](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/tree/master/tensorflow_datasets/translate/ted_multi.py)

`ted_multi_translate` is configured with
`tfds.translate.ted_multi.BuilderConfig` and has the following configurations
predefined (defaults to the first one):

*   `plain_text` (`v0.0.3`) (`Size: 335.91 MiB`): Plain text import of
    multilingual TED talk translations

## `ted_multi_translate/plain_text`

```python
FeaturesDict({
    'talk_name': Text(shape=(), dtype=tf.string),
    'translations': TranslationVariableLanguages({
        'language': Text(shape=(), dtype=tf.string),
        'translation': Text(shape=(), dtype=tf.string),
    }),
})
```

  abstract  = {The performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems often suffers in low-resource scenarios where sufficiently large-scale parallel corpora cannot be obtained. Pre-trained word embeddings have proven to be invaluable for improving performance in natural language analysis tasks, which often suffer from paucity of data. However, their utility for NMT has not been extensively explored. In this work, we perform five sets of experiments that analyze when we can expect pre-trained word embeddings to help in NMT tasks. We show that such embeddings can be surprisingly effective in some cases -- providing gains of up to 20 BLEU points in the most favorable setting.},
