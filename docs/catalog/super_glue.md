## super_glue/cb

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The CommitmentBank (De Marneffe et al., 2019) is a corpus of short texts in
which at least one sentence contains an embedded clause. Each of these embedded
clauses is annotated with the degree to which we expect that the person who
wrote the text is committed to the truth of the clause. The resulting task
framed as three-class textual entailment on examples that are drawn from the
Wall Street Journal, fiction from the British National Corpus, and Switchboard.
Each example consists of a premise containing an embedded clause and the
corresponding hypothesis is the extraction of that clause. We use a subset of
the data that had inter-annotator agreement above 0.85. The data is imbalanced
(relatively fewer neutral examples), so we evaluate using accuracy and F1, where
for multi-class F1 we compute the unweighted average of the F1 per class.

## super_glue/copa

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The Choice Of Plausible Alternatives (COPA, Roemmele et al., 2011) dataset is a
causal reasoning task in which a system is given a premise sentence and two
possible alternatives. The system must choose the alternative which has the more
plausible causal relationship with the premise. The method used for the
construction of the alternatives ensures that the task requires causal reasoning
to solve. Examples either deal with alternative possible causes or alternative
possible effects of the premise sentence, accompanied by a simple question
disambiguating between the two instance types for the model. All examples are
handcrafted and focus on topics from online blogs and a photography-related
encyclopedia. Following the recommendation of the authors, we evaluate using
accuracy.

## super_glue/multirc

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension dataset (MultiRC, Khashabi et al.,
2018) is a true/false question-answering task. Each example consists of a
context paragraph, a question about that paragraph, and a list of possible
answers to that question which must be labeled as true or false.
Question-answering (QA) is a popular problem with many datasets. We use MultiRC
because of a number of desirable properties: (i) each question can have multiple
possible correct answers, so each question-answer pair must be evaluated
independent of other pairs, (ii) the questions are designed such that answering
each question requires drawing facts from multiple context sentences, and (iii)
the question-answer pair format more closely matches the API of other SuperGLUE
tasks than span-based extractive QA does. The paragraphs are drawn from seven
domains including news, fiction, and historical text.

## super_glue/rte

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) datasets come from a series of annual
competitions on textual entailment, the problem of predicting whether a given
premise sentence entails a given hypothesis sentence (also known as natural
language inference, NLI). RTE was previously included in GLUE, and we use the
same data and format as before: We merge data from RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006),
RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and RTE5
(Bentivogli et al., 2009). All datasets are combined and converted to two-class
classification: entailment and not_entailment. Of all the GLUE tasks, RTE was
among those that benefited from transfer learning the most, jumping from near
random-chance performance (~56%) at the time of GLUE's launch to 85% accuracy
(Liu et al., 2019c) at the time of writing. Given the eight point gap with
respect to human performance, however, the task is not yet solved by machines,
and we expect the remaining gap to be difficult to close.

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The Word-in-Context (WiC, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) dataset supports
a word sense disambiguation task cast as binary classification over sentence
pairs. Given two sentences and a polysemous (sense-ambiguous) word that appears
in both sentences, the task is to determine whether the word is used with the
same sense in both sentences. Sentences are drawn from WordNet (Miller, 1995),
VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and Wiktionary. We follow the original work and
evaluate using accuracy.

## super_glue/wsc

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC, Levesque et al., 2012) is a reading
comprehension task in which a system must read a sentence with a pronoun and
select the referent of that pronoun from a list of choices. Given the difficulty
of this task and the headroom still left, we have included WSC in SuperGLUE and
recast the dataset into its coreference form. The task is cast as a binary
classification problem, as opposed to N-multiple choice, in order to isolate the
model's ability to understand the coreference links within a sentence as opposed
to various other strategies that may come into play in multiple choice
conditions. With that in mind, we create a split with 65% negative majority
class in the validation set, reflecting the distribution of the hidden test set,
and 52% negative class in the training set. The training and validation examples
are drawn from the original Winograd Schema dataset (Levesque et al., 2012), as
well as those distributed by the affiliated organization Commonsense Reasoning.
The test examples are derived from fiction books and have been shared with us by
the authors of the original dataset. Previously, a version of WSC recast as NLI
as included in GLUE, known as WNLI. No substantial progress was made on WNLI,
with many submissions opting to submit only majority class predictions. WNLI was
made especially difficult due to an adversarial train/dev split: Premise
sentences that appeared in the training set sometimes appeared in the
development set with a different hypothesis and a flipped label. If a system
memorized the training set without meaningfully generalizing, which was easy due
to the small size of the training set, it could perform far below chance on the
development set. We remove this adversarial design in the SuperGLUE version of
WSC by ensuring that no sentences are shared between the training, validation,
and test sets.

However, the validation and test sets come from different domains, with the
validation set consisting of ambiguous examples such that changing one non-noun
phrase word will change the coreference dependencies in the sentence. The test
set consists only of more straightforward examples, with a high number of noun
phrases (and thus more choices for the model), but low to no ambiguity.

## super_glue/axb

*   **Description**:

SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after
GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved
resources, and a new public leaderboard.

An expert-constructed, diagnostic dataset that automatically tests models for a
broad range of linguistic, commonsense, and world knowledge. Each example in
this broad-coverage diagnostic is a sentence pair labeled with a three-way
entailment relation (entailment, neutral, or contradiction) and tagged with
labels that indicate the phenomena that characterize the relationship between
the two sentences. Submissions to the GLUE leaderboard are required to include
predictions from the submission's MultiNLI classifier on the diagnostic dataset,
and analyses of the results were shown alongside the main leaderboard. Since
this broad-coverage diagnostic task has proved difficult for top models, we
retain it in SuperGLUE. However, since MultiNLI is not part of SuperGLUE, we
collapse contradiction and neutral into a single not_entailment label, and
request that submissions include predictions on the resulting set from the model
used for the RTE task.

resources, and a new public leaderboard.

Winogender is designed to measure gender bias in coreference resolution systems.
We use the Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection (DNC; Poliak et al.,
2018) version that casts Winogender as a textual entailment task. Each example
consists of a premise sentence with a male or female pronoun and a hypothesis
giving a possible antecedent of the pronoun. Examples occur in minimal pairs,
where the only difference between an example and its pair is the gender of the
pronoun in the premise. Performance on Winogender is measured with both accuracy
and the gender parity score: the percentage of minimal pairs for which the
predictions are the same. We note that a system can trivially obtain a perfect
gender parity score by guessing the same class for all examples, so a high
gender parity score is meaningless unless accompanied by high accuracy. As a
diagnostic test of gender bias, we view the schemas as having high positive
predictive value and low negative predictive value; that is, they may
demonstrate the presence of gender bias in a system, but not prove its absence.
