The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across
20 different newsgroups. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of
machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

sorted by date into training(60%) and test(40%) sets, does not include cross-posts (duplicates) and does not include newsgroup-identifying headers (Xref, Newsgroups, Path, Followup-To, Date)
