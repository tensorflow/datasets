# TensorFlow Datasets

TensorFlow Datasets provides many public datasets as `tf.data.Datasets`.

## Documentation

To install and use TFDS, we strongly encourage to start with our
[**getting started guide**](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview). Try
it interactively in a
[Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/docs/overview.ipynb).

Our documentation contains:

* [Tutorials and guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview)
* List of all [available datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#all_datasets)
* The [API reference](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds)

```python
# !pip install tensorflow-datasets
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import tensorflow as tf

# Construct a tf.data.Dataset
ds = tfds.load('mnist', split='train', as_supervised=True, shuffle_files=True)

# Build your input pipeline
ds = ds.shuffle(1000).batch(128).prefetch(10).take(5)
for image, label in ds:
  pass
```

## TFDS core values

TFDS has been built with these principles in mind:

* **Simplicity**: Standard use-cases should work out-of-the box
* **Performance**: TFDS follows
  [best practices](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance)
  and can achieve state-of-the-art speed
* **Determinism/reproducibility**: All users get the same examples in the same
  order
* **Customisability**: Advanced users can have fine-grained control

If those use cases are not satisfied, please send us
[feedback](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues).

## Want a certain dataset?

Adding a dataset is really straightforward by following
[our guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset).

Request a dataset by opening a
[Dataset request GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dataset+request&template=dataset-request.md&title=%5Bdata+request%5D+%3Cdataset+name%3E).

And vote on the current
[set of requests](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/labels/dataset%20request)
by adding a thumbs-up reaction to the issue.

### Citation

Please include the following citation when using `tensorflow-datasets` for a
paper, in addition to any citation specific to the used datasets.

```
@misc{TFDS,
  title = {{TensorFlow Datasets}, A collection of ready-to-use datasets},
