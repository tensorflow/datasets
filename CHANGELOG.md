# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   [Segment Anything](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads)
    (SA-1B) dataset.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [4.9.2] - 2023-04-13

### Added

-   [Experimental] A list of freeform text tags can now be attached to a
    `BuilderConfig`. For example:
    ```py
    BUILDER_CONFIGS = [
        tfds.core.BuilderConfig(name="foo", tags=["foo", "live"]),
        tfds.core.BuilderConfig(name="bar", tags=["bar", "old"]),
    ]
    ```
    The tags are recorded with the dataset metadata and can later be retrieved
    using the info object:
    ```py
    builder.info.config_tags  # ["foo", "live"]
    ```
    This feature is experimental and there are no guidelines on tags format.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

-   Fixed generated proto files (see issue [4858](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/4858)).

### Security

## [4.9.1] - 2023-04-11

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

-   The installation on macOS now works (see issues
    [4805](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/4805) and
    [4852](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/4852)). The ArrayRecord
    dependency is lazily loaded, so the
    [TensorFlow-less path](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/tfless_tfds) is
    not possible at the moment on macOS. A fix for this will follow soon.

### Security

## [4.9.0] - 2023-04-04

### Added

-   Native support for JAX and PyTorch. TensorFlow is no longer a dependency for
    reading datasets. See the
    [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/tfless_tfds).
-   Added minival split to
    [LVIS dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/lvis).
-   [Mixed-human](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/robomimic_mh) and
    [machine-generated](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/robomimic_mg)
    robomimic datasets.
-   WebVid dataset.
-   ImagenetPI dataset.
-   [Wikipedia](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wikipedia) for
    20230201.

### Changed

-   Support for `tensorflow=2.12`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [4.8.3] - 2023-02-27

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

-   Python 3.7 support: this version and future version use Python 3.8.

### Removed

### Fixed

-   Flag `ignore_verifications` from Hugging Face's `datasets.load_dataset` is
    deprecated, and used to cause errors in `tfds.load(huggingface:foo)`.

### Security

## [4.8.2] - 2023-01-17

### Deprecated

-   Python 3.7 support: this is the last version of TFDS supporting Python 3.7.
    Future versions will use Python 3.8.

### Fixed

-   `tfds new` and `tfds build` better support the new recommended datasets
    organization, where individual datasets have their own package under
    `datasets/`, builder class is called `Builder` and is defined within module
    `${dsname}_dataset_builder.py`.

### Security

## [4.8.1] - 2023-01-02

### Changed

- Added file `valid_tags.txt` to not break builds.
- TFDS no longer relies on TensorFlow DTypes. We chose NumPy DTypes to keep the
typing expressiveness, while dropping the heavy dependency on TensorFlow. We
migrated all our internal datasets. Please, migrate accordingly:
    - `tf.bool`: `np.bool_`
    - `tf.string`: `np.str_`
    - `tf.int64`, `tf.int32`, etc: `np.int64`, `np.int32`, etc
    - `tf.float64`, `tf.float32`, etc: `np.float64`, `np.float32`, etc


## [4.8.0] - 2022-12-21

### Added

-   [API] `DatasetBuilder`'s description and citations can be specified in
    dedicated `README.md` and `CITATIONS.bib` files, within the dataset package
    (see https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset).
-   Tags can be associated to Datasets, in the `TAGS.txt` file. For
    now, they are only used in the generated documentation.
-   [API][Experimental] New `ViewBuilder` to define datasets as transformations
    of existing datasets. Also adds `tfds.transform` with functionality to apply
    transformations.
-   Loggers are also called on `tfds.as_numpy(...)`, base `Logger` class has a
    new corresponding method.
-   `tfds.core.DatasetBuilder` can have a default limit for the number of
    simultaneous downloads. `tfds.download.DownloadConfig` can override it.
-   `tfds.features.Audio` supports storing raw audio data for lazy decoding.
-   The number of shards can be overridden when preparing a dataset:
    `builder.download_and_prepare(download_config=tfds.download.DownloadConfig(num_shards=42))`.
    Alternatively, you can configure the min and max shard size if you want TFDS
    to compute the number of shards for you, but want to have control over the
    shard sizes.

### Changed

### Deprecated

    [TfDataBuilder](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/format_specific_dataset_builders#datasets_based_on_tfdatadataset)
    that is handy for storing experimental ad hoc TFDS datasets in notebook-like
    environments such that they can be versioned, described, and easily shared
    with teammates.
-   [API] Added options to create format-specific dataset builders. The new API
    now includes a number of NLP-specific builders, such as:
    -   [CoNNL](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/format_specific_dataset_builders#conll)
    -   [CoNNL-U](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/format_specific_dataset_builders#conllu)
-   [API] Added `tfds.beam.inc_counter` to reduce `beam.metrics.Metrics.counter`
    boilerplate
-   [API] Added options to group together existing TFDS datasets into
    [dataset collections](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/dataset_collections)
    and to perform simple operations over them.
-   [Documentation] update, specifically:
    -   [New guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/format_specific_dataset_builders)
        on format-specific dataset builders;
    -   [New guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset_collection)
        on adding new dataset collections to TFDS;
    -   Updated [TFDS CLI](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/cli)
        documentation.
-   [TFDS CLI] Supports custom config through Json (e.g. `tfds build my_dataset
    --config='{"name": "my_custom_config", "description": "Abc"}'`)
-   New datasets:
    -   [conll2003](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/conll2003)
    -   [universal_dependency 2.10](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/universal_dependency)

        Translation of Noisy Text.
    -   [placesfull](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/placesfull)
    -   [tatoeba](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tatoeba)
    -   [user_libri_audio](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/user_libri_audio)
    -   [user_libri_text](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/user_libri_text)
    -   [xtreme_pos](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/xtreme_pos)
    -   [yahoo_ltrc](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/yahoo_ltrc)
-   Updated datasets:
    -   [C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) was updated to
        version 3.1.
    -   [common_voice](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/common_voice)
        was updated to a more recent snapshot.
    -   [wikipedia](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wikipedia) was
        updated with the `20220620` snapshot.
-   New dataset collections, such as
    [xtreme](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/dataset_collections/xtreme/xtreme.py)
    and
    [LongT5](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/dataset_collections/longt5/longt5.py)

### Changed

-   The base `Logger` class expects more information to be passed to the
    `as_dataset` method. This should only be relevant to people who have
    implemented and registered custom `Logger` class(es).
-   You can set `DEFAULT_BUILDER_CONFIG_NAME` in a `DatasetBuilder` to change
    the default config if it shouldn't be the first builder config defined in
    `BUILDER_CONFIGS`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

-   Various datasets
-   In Linux, when loading a dataset from a directory that is not your home
    (`~`) directory, a new `~` directory is not created in the current directory
    (fixes [#4117](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/4117)).

## [4.2.0] - 2021-01-06

### Added

-   [CLI] `tfds build` to the CLI. See
    [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/cli#tfds_build_download_and_prepare_a_dataset).
-   [API] `tfds.features.Dataset` to represent nested datasets.
-   [API] `tfds.ReadConfig(add_tfds_id=True)` to add a unique id to the example
    `ex['tfds_id']` (e.g. `b'train.tfrecord-00012-of-01024__123'`).
-   [API] `num_parallel_calls` option to `tfds.ReadConfig` to overwrite to
    default `AUTOTUNE` option.
-   [API] `tfds.ImageFolder` support for `tfds.decode.SkipDecoder`.
-   [API] Multichannel audio support to `tfds.features.Audio`.
-   [API] `try_gcs` to `tfds.builder(..., try_gcs=True)`
-   Better `tfds.as_dataframe` visualization (ffmpeg video if installed,
    bounding boxes,...).
-   [TESTING] Allow `max_examples_per_splits=0` in `tfds build
    --max_examples_per_splits=0` to test `_split_generators` only (without
    `_generate_examples`).
-   New datasets.

### Changed

-   [API] DownloadManager now returns
    [Pathlib-like](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use)
    objects.
-   [API] Simpler `BuilderConfig` definition: class `VERSION` and
    `RELEASE_NOTES` are applied to all `BuilderConfig`. Config description is
    now optional.
-   [API] To guarantee better deterministic, new validations are performed on
    the keys when creating a dataset (to avoid filenames as keys
    (non-deterministic) and restrict key to `str`, `bytes` and `int`). New
    errors likely indicates an issue in the dataset implementation.
-   [API] `tfds.core.benchmark` now returns a `pd.DataFrame` (instead of a
    `dict`).
-   [API] `tfds.units` is not visible anymore from the public API.
-   Datasets updates.

### Deprecated

### Removed

-   Configs for all text datasets. Only plain text version is kept. For example:
    `multi_nli/plain_text` -> `multi_nli`.

### Fixed

-   [API] Datasets returned by `tfds.as_numpy` are compatible with `len(ds)`.
-   Support 0-len sequence with images of dynamic shape (Fix #2616).
-   Progression bar correctly updated when copying files.
-   Better debugging and error message (e.g. human readable size,...).
-   Many bug fixes (GPath consistency with pathlib, s3 compatibility, TQDM
    visual artifacts, GCS crash on windows, re-download when checksums updated,
    ...).

## [4.1.0] - 2020-11-04

### Added

-   It is now easier to create datasets outside TFDS repository (see our updated
    [dataset creation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset)).
-   When generating a dataset, if download fails for any reason, it is now
    possible to manually download the data. See
    [doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview#manual_download_if_download_fails).
-   `tfds.core.as_path` to create pathlib.Path-like objects compatible with GCS
    (e.g. `tfds.core.as_path('gs://my-bucket/labels.csv').read_text()`).
-   `verify_ssl=` option to `tfds.download.DownloadConfig` to disable SSH
    certificate during download.
-   New datasets. ### Changed
-   All dataset inherit from `tfds.core.GeneratorBasedBuilder`. Converting a
    dataset to beam now only require changing `_generate_examples` (see
    [example and doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/beam_datasets#instructions)).
-   `_split_generators` should now returns `{'split_name':
    self._generate_examples(), ...}` (but current datasets are backward
    compatible).
-   Better `pathlib.Path`, `os.PathLike` compatibility: `dl_manager.manual_dir`
    now returns a pathlib-Like object. Example: `python text =
    (dl_manager.manual_dir / 'downloaded-text.txt').read_text()` Note: Other
    `dl_manager.download`, `.extract`,... will return pathlib-like objects in
    future versions. `FeatureConnector`,... and most functions should accept
    `PathLike` objects. Let us know if some functions you need are missing.
-   `--record_checksums` now assume the new dataset-as-folder model.

### Deprecated

-   `tfds.core.SplitGenerator`, `tfds.core.BeamBasedBuilder` are deprecated and
    will be removed in a future version.

### Fixed

-   `BuilderConfig` are now compatible with Beam datasets #2348
-   `tfds.features.Images` can accept encoded `bytes` images directly (useful
    when used with `img_name, img_bytes =
    dl_manager.iter_archive('images.zip')`).
-   Doc API now show deprecated methods, abstract methods to overwrite are now
    documented.
-   You can generate `imagenet2012` with only a single split (e.g. only the
    validation data). Other split will be skipped if not present.

## [4.0.1] - 2020-10-09

### Fixed

-   `tfds.load` when generation code isn't present.
-   GCS compatibility.

## [4.0.0] - 2020-10-06

### Added

-   Dataset-as-folder: Dataset can now be self-contained module in a folder with
    checksums, dummy data,... This simplify implementing datasets outside the
    TFDS repository.
-   `tfds.load` can now load dataset without using the generation class. So
    `tfds.load('my_dataset:1.0.0')` can work even if `MyDataset.VERSION ==
    '2.0.0'` (See #2493).
-   TFDS CLI (see https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/cli for detail).
-   `tfds.testing.mock_data` does not require metadata files anymore!
-   `tfds.as_dataframe(ds, ds_info)` with custom visualisation
    ([example](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview#tfdsas_dataframe)).
-   `tfds.even_splits` to generate subsplits (e.g. `tfds.even_splits('train',
    n=3) == ['train[0%:33%]', 'train[33%:67%]', ...]`.
-   `DatasetBuilder.RELEASE_NOTES` property.
-   `tfds.features.Image` now supports PNG with 4-channels.
-   `tfds.ImageFolder` now supports custom shape, dtype.
-   Downloaded URLs are available through `MyDataset.url_infos`.
-   `skip_prefetch` option to `tfds.ReadConfig`.
-   `as_supervised=True` support for `tfds.show_examples`, `tfds.as_dataframe`.
-   tfds.features can now be saved/loaded, you may have to overwrite
    [FeatureConnector.from_json_content](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/features/FeatureConnector?version=nightly#from_json_content)
    and `FeatureConnector.to_json_content` to support this feature.
-   Script to detect dead-urls.
-   New datasets.

### Changed

-   `tfds.as_numpy()` now returns an iterable which can be iterated multiple
    times. To migrate: `next(ds)` -> `next(iter(ds))`.
-   Rename `tfds.features.text.Xyz` -> `tfds.deprecated.text.Xyz`.

### Removed

-   `DatasetBuilder.IN_DEVELOPMENT` property.
-   `tfds.core.disallow_positional_args` (should use Py3 `*,` instead).
-   Testing against TF 1.15. Requires Python 3.6.8+.

### Fixed

-   Better archive extension detection for `dl_manager.download_and_extract`.
-   Fix `tfds.__version__` in TFDS nightly to be PEP440 compliant
-   Fix crash when GCS not available.
-   Improved open-source workflow, contributor guide, documentation.
-   Many other internal cleanups, bugs, dead code removal, py2->py3 cleanup,
    pytype annotations,...
-   Datasets updates.

## [3.2.1] - 2020-08-12

### Fixed

-   Issue with GCS on Windows.

## [3.2.0] - 2020-07-10

### Added

-   [API] `tfds.ImageFolder` and `tfds.TranslateFolder` to easily create custom
    datasets with your custom data.
-   [API] `tfds.ReadConfig(input_context=)` to shard dataset, for better
    multi-worker compatibility (#1426).
-   [API] The default `data_dir` can be controlled by the `TFDS_DATA_DIR`
    environment variable.
-   [API] Better usability when developing datasets outside TFDS: downloads are
    always cached, checksums are optional.
-   Scripts to help deployment/documentation (Generate catalog documentation,
    export all metadata files, ...).
-   [Documentation] Catalog display images
    ([example](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/sun397#sun397standard-part2-120k)).
-   [Documentation] Catalog shows which dataset have been recently added and are
    only available in `tfds-nightly`
    <span class="material-icons">nights_stay</span>.
-   [API] `tfds.show_statistics(ds_info)` to display
    [FACETS OVERVIEW](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/). Note: This require
    the dataset to have been generated with the statistics.

### Deprecated

-   `tfds.features.text` encoding API. Please use
    [tensorflow_text](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tensorflow_text/intro)
    instead.

### Removed

-   `tfds.load('image_label_folder')` in favor of the more user-friendly
    `tfds.ImageFolder`.

### Fixed

-   Fix deterministic example order on Windows when path was used as key (this
    only impacts a few datasets). Now example order should be the same on all
    platforms.
-   Misc performances improvements for both generation and reading (e.g. use
    `__slot__`, fix parallelisation bug in `tf.data.TFRecordReader`, ...).
-   Misc fixes (typo, types annotations, better error messages, fixing dead
    links, better windows compatibility, ...).

## [3.1.0] - 2020-04-29

### Added

-   [API] `tfds.builder_cls(name)` to access a DatasetBuilder class by name
-   [API] `info.split['train'].filenames` for access to the tf-record files.
-   [API] `tfds.core.add_data_dir` to register an additional data dir.
-   [Testing] Support for custom decoders in `tfds.testing.mock_data`.
-   [Documentation] Shows which datasets are only present in `tfds-nightly`.
-   [Documentation] Display images for supported datasets.

### Changed

-   Rename `tfds.core.NamedSplit`, `tfds.core.SplitBase` -> `tfds.Split`. Now
    `tfds.Split.TRAIN`,... are instance of `tfds.Split`.
-   Rename `interleave_parallel_reads` -> `interleave_cycle_length` for
    `tfds.ReadConfig`.
-   Invert ds, ds_info argument orders for `tfds.show_examples`.

### Deprecated

-   `tfds.features.text` encoding API. Please use `tensorflow_text` instead.

### Removed

-   `num_shards` argument from `tfds.core.SplitGenerator`. This argument was
    ignored as shards are automatically computed.
-   Most `ds.with_options` which where applied by TFDS. Now use `tf.data`
    default.

### Fixed

-   Better error messages.
-   Windows compatibility.

## [3.0.0] - 2020-04-16

### Added

-   `DownloadManager` is now pickable (can be used inside Beam pipelines).
-   `tfds.features.Audio`:
    -   Support float as returned value.
    -   Expose sample_rate through `info.features['audio'].sample_rate`.
    -   Support for encoding audio features from file objects.
-   More datasets.

### Changed

-   New `image_classification` section. Some datasets have been move there from
    `images`.
-   `DownloadConfig` does not append the dataset name anymore (manual data
    should be in `<manual_dir>/` instead of `<manual_dir>/<dataset_name>/`).
-   Tests now check that all `dl_manager.download` urls has registered
    checksums. To opt-out, add `SKIP_CHECKSUMS = True` to your
    `DatasetBuilderTestCase`.
-   `tfds.load` now always returns `tf.compat.v2.Dataset`. If you're using still
    using `tf.compat.v1`:
    -   Use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(ds)` rather than
        `ds.make_one_shot_iterator()`.
    -   Use `isinstance(ds, tf.compat.v2.Dataset)` instead of `isinstance(ds,
        tf.data.Dataset)`.

### Deprecated

-   The `tfds.features.text` encoding API is deprecated. Please use
    [tensorflow_text](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tensorflow_text/intro)
    instead.
-   `num_shards` argument of `tfds.core.SplitGenerator` is currently ignored and
    will be removed in the next version.

### Removed

-   Legacy mode `tfds.experiment.S3` has been removed
-   `in_memory` argument has been removed from `as_dataset`/`tfds.load` (small
    datasets are now auto-cached).
-   `tfds.Split.ALL`.

### Fixed

-   Various bugs, better error messages, documentation improvements.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-02-25

### Added

-   Datasets expose `info.dataset_size` and `info.download_size`.
-   [Auto-caching small datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/performances#auto-caching).
-   Datasets expose their cardinality `num_examples =
    tf.data.experimental.cardinality(ds)` (Requires tf-nightly or TF >= 2.2.0)
-   Get the number of example in a sub-splits with:
    `info.splits['train[70%:]'].num_examples`

### Changes

-   All datasets generated with 2.1.0 cannot be loaded with previous version
    (previous datasets can be read with `2.1.0` however).

### Deprecated

-   `in_memory` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-01-24

### Added

-   Several new datasets. Thanks to all the
    [contributors](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/graphs/contributors)!
-   Support for nested `tfds.features.Sequence` and `tf.RaggedTensor`
-   Custom `FeatureConnector`s can override the `decode_batch_example` method
    for efficient decoding when wrapped inside a
    `tfds.features.Sequence(my_connector)`.
-   Beam datasets can use a `tfds.core.BeamMetadataDict` to store additional
    metadata computed as part of the Beam pipeline.
-   Beam datasets' `_split_generators` accepts an additional `pipeline` kwargs
    to define a pipeline shared between all splits.

### Changed

-   The default versions of all datasets are now using the S3 slicing API. See
    the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/splits) for details.
-   `shuffle_files` defaults to False so that dataset iteration is deterministic
    by default. You can customize the reading pipeline, including shuffling and
    interleaving, through the new `read_config` parameter in
    [`tfds.load`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds/load).
-   `urls` kwargs renamed `homepage` in `DatasetInfo`

### Deprecated

-   Python2 support: this is the last version of TFDS that will support
    Python 2. Going forward, we'll only support and test against Python 3.
-   The previous split API is still available, but is deprecated. If you wrote
    `DatasetBuilder`s outside the TFDS repository, please make sure they do not
    use `experiments={tfds.core.Experiment.S3: False}`. This will be removed in
    the next version, as well as the `num_shards` kwargs from `SplitGenerator`.

### Fixed

-   Various other bug fixes and performance improvements. Thank you for all the
    reports and fixes!

    Default behaviour will change to always be False at next major release.
-   Most datasets now support the new S3 API
    ([documentation](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/docs/splits.md#two-apis-s3-and-legacy)).
