Wikipedia tables with at least 3 rows and 2 columns, 3 random rows for each
table were selected for further annotation. Each row was annotated by a
different person, so the dataset is composed by (one row table, text
description) pairs. Annotations include at least 2 cells of the row, but do not
require to include them all. The dataset follows a standarized table format.
