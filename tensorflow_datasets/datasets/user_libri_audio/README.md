UserLibri is a dataset containing paired audio-transcripts and additional text
only data for each of 107 users. It is a reformatting of the LibriSpeech dataset
found at http://www.openslr.org/12, reorganizing the data into users with an
average of 52 LibriSpeech utterances and about 6,700 text example sentences per
user. The UserLibriAudio class provides access to the audio-transcript pairs.
See UserLibriText for the additional text data.
