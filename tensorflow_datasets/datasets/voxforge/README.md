VoxForge is a language classification dataset. It consists of user submitted
audio clips submitted to the website. In this release, data from 6 languages is
collected - English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Italian. Since the
website is constantly updated, and for the sake of reproducibility, this release
contains only recordings submitted prior to 2020-01-01. The samples are splitted
between train, validation and testing so that samples from each speaker belongs
to exactly one split.
