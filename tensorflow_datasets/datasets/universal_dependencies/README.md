Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar
(parts of speech, morphological features, and syntactic dependencies) across
different human languages. UD is an open community effort with over 300
contributors producing more than 200 treebanks in over 100 languages. If youâ€™re
new to UD, you should start by reading the first part of the Short Introduction
and then browsing the annotation guidelines.
