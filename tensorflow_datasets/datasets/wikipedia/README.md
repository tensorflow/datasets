Wikipedia dataset containing cleaned articles of all languages. The datasets are
built from the Wikipedia dump (https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) with one split per
language. Each example contains the content of one full Wikipedia article with
cleaning to strip markdown and unwanted sections (references, etc.).
