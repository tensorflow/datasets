A new dataset of 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science
questions, assembled to encourage research in advanced question-answering. The
dataset is partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set, where the former
contains only questions answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm
and a word co-occurrence algorithm. We are also including a corpus of over 14
million science sentences relevant to the task, and an implementation of three
neural baseline models for this dataset. We pose ARC as a challenge to the
community.
