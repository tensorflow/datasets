The comments in this dataset come from an archive of Wikipedia talk page
comments. These have been annotated by Jigsaw for toxicity, as well as (for the
main config) a variety of toxicity subtypes, including severe toxicity,
obscenity, threatening language, insulting language, and identity attacks. This
dataset is a replica of the data released for the Jigsaw Toxic Comment
Classification Challenge and Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification
competition on Kaggle, with the test dataset merged with the test_labels
released after the end of the competitions. Test data not used for scoring has
been dropped. This dataset is released under CC0, as is the underlying comment
text.
