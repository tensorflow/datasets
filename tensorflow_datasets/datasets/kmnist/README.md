Kuzushiji-MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale,
70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format.
Since MNIST restricts us to 10 classes, we chose one character to represent each
of the 10 rows of Hiragana when creating Kuzushiji-MNIST.
