who got the first nobel prize in physics?\ndeveloped further . they were preceded by such key physicists as hermann von helmholtz , joseph von fraunhofer , and gabriel daniel fahrenheit , among others . wilhelm conrad rontgen discovered x - rays , an accomplishment that made him the first winner of the nobel prize in physics in 1901 and eventually earned him an element name , roentgenium . heinrich rudolf hertz ' s work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation were pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication . mathematical aerodynamics was developed in germany , especially by ludwig prandtl . paul forman in 1971 argued the remarkable scientific achievements in quantum physics were the cross - product of the hostile intellectual atmosphere whereby - his son , george paget thomson , received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves . william henry bragg and his son , william lawrence bragg , shared the physics prize in 1915 for inventing the x - ray spectrometer . niels bohr was awarded the physics prize in 1922 , as was his son , aage bohr , in 1975 . manne siegbahn , who received the physics prize in 1924 , was the father of kai siegbahn , who received the physics prize in 1981 . hans von euler - chelpin , who received the chemistry prize in 1929 , was the father of ulf von euler , who was awarded - the nobel prize in physics , " in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by professor henri becquerel . " at first the committee had intended to honor only pierre curie and henri becquerel , but a committee member and advocate for women scientists , swedish mathematician magnus goesta mittag - leffler , alerted pierre to the situation , and after his complaint , marie ' s name was added to the nomination . marie curie was the first woman to be awarded a nobel prize . curie and her husband declined to go to stockholm to receive the prize in person ; they were - had no bearing on marconi ' s claim as the first to achieve radio transmission , just that since marconi ' s claim to certain patented improvements were questionable , the company could not claim infringement on those same patents . on 6 november 1915 , a reuters news agency report from london had the 1915 nobel prize in physics awarded to thomas edison and nikola tesla ; however , on 15 november , a reuters story from stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to sir william henry bragg and william lawrence bragg " for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of x - rays . " there were - nobel prize in physics the nobel prize in physics ( ) is a yearly award given by the royal swedish academy of sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics . it is one of the five nobel prizes established by the will of alfred nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901 ; the others being the nobel prize in chemistry , nobel prize in literature , nobel peace prize , and nobel prize in physiology or medicine . the first nobel prize in physics was awarded to physicist wilhelm rontgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he - with her husband frederic joliot - curie . in addition , the husband of marie curie '	Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen
