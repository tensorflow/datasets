What is the name of the character who gets trapped by a seatbelt?\n(Alien 51) The plot revolves around a series of murders that take place over two years in the Nevada Desert near Groom Lake. The movie opens with a woman being chased through the desert by an unseen creature, but then she wakes up revealing it to be a nightmare. Traci and her boyfriend Gibson are driving across the desert at night. Gibson keeps talking about Area 51, but Traci is only interested in reaching Las Vegas. In order to get Gibson to shut up and keep driving, Traci takes her top off and straddles his lap. Because of her distraction he runs over something, blowing out a tire. Gibson stops to change the tire, but immediately vanishes when he gets out of the car. Traci searches for him, but only finds a bloody tire iron. She runs back to the car, lights a cigarette and drives away. However, she eventually finds him and picks him up. They soon have an accident and are trapped by the seatbelt. The monster picks up her cigarette outside the car and ignites the gasoline leaking from the car, setting it and Traci on fire. Several people are attacked at a small carnival, by an alien. This draws the attention of Dr. Cleo Browning. Dr. Browning discusses killing the creature with Sheriff Sam Cash, but she is overheard by animal rights activist Roxanne, and her boyfriend Albert.  Roxanne thinks that if they capture the alien they can expose to the world what the government is doing to animals.  In the meantime, three of the carnival workers set out to capture the alien and add it to the sideshow. Cash and Dr. Browning meet with Cletus. He speculates that the alien is living in a cave in the mountains. While the two are meeting with Cletus, Roxanne attempts to slash the sheriff's tires, sending Albert to act as a lookout. Unable to cut the tires, she looks for Albert, but is unable to find him. Eventually, when she discovers his body, she screams and starts to run, but she also killed by the alien.	Traci///Gibson
Who did the strangled person date?\n(Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2) The sequel picks up on Christmas Eve some years after the first movie, with Ricky Caldwell, the 18-year-old brother of the first film's killer, now being held in a mental hospital, awaiting trial for a series of murders that he committed. While being interviewed by the psychiatrist Dr. Henry Bloom, Ricky tells the story of the murders his brother Billy committed throughout a series of several flashbacks using footage from the original film. These flashbacks have new shots to make Ricky appear in more of Billy's original story. After this, Ricky tells his own story: after Billy's death, he was adopted and given a good upbringing, but his trauma was never treated. After his foster father's death, Ricky loses his composure and commits a series of random murders, targeting people who are "naughty". A chance for a normal life seems to appear when he starts dating Jennifer Statson, but an unpleasant encounter with Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Chip sends Ricky over the edge. He kills Chip by electrocuting him with jumper cables that are attached to a car while Jennifer watches, and uses the car antenna to strangle Jennifer to death. A security guard witnesses this and as Ricky is about to get arrested, he grabs the guard's gun, shoots him in the forehead, and goes on a shooting spree. He kills at least three more people throughout a suburban neighborhood, including shooting one man through a garbage can after yelling "Garbage Day!" Later on, Ricky gets himself into a stand-off where he tries and fails to commit suicide before getting arrested by the police.	Ricky Caldwell///Chip
What is the first name of the person who loses the auction for the hut?\n(Snowbound (1948 film)) British film director Derek Engles recognises Neil Blair, a former extras in one of his earlier productions. In order to investigate some intelligence which he had picked up in Italy, Engles offers Blair a new job because he trusts him (he used to be Blair's commanding officer). He wants Blair to keep him posted on the activities of everyone who stays at a ski hut, whilst he poses as a scriptwriter. Blair accepts this offer. Engles warns him to look out for a Carla Rometta and sends along a cameraman, Joe Wesson, to accompany him. At the inn, Aldo, the indifferent innkeeper, tells themthat there are no rooms available, however guest Stefano Valdini helps them to find a room. Englishman Gilbert Mayne also takes a room. Blair soon encounters Rometta, who calls herself the Comtessa Forelli. That night, a Greek named Keramikos also arrives. When Blair makes his first report, Engles is particularly interested in the fact that the hut is to be auctioned off the next day. The proprietor of the hotel below confides to Blair that the auction is rigged and that there will only be one bid, his, but instead there is a heated bidding war involving Valdini (on the Comtessa's behalf) and a lawyer for an unknown party. The latter wins the auction by making an excessive bid. Keramikos tells Blair that he is not truly there to write a script. He also claims that Mayne was a deserter from the British Army who ended up working for him in Greece, though he declines to divulge any more. Blair begins falling in love with the comtessa, who admits she is Carla. Very late at night, by chance, Blair spots Keramikos speaking German with another man. However, when Blair confronts Keramikos, the Greek tells him to mind his own business.	Stefano
