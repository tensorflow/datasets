Which cup has a higher concentration of sugar? \n Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let's say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail. His son came along and saw the two cups and decided to put some sugar in them to make a tasty drink. The child poured two spoonfuls of sugar into cup A and three spoonfuls of sugar into cup B. 	cup B

Which cell has a larger volume? \n As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but are not the same age. Cell X was created two weeks ago, and cell Z was created one month ago. Therefore, cell Z has had two extra weeks of growth compared to cell X. 	cell Z
