Which group has a higher likely hood of brain damage? \n Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components. There is a study being conducted on a group of small children. Group A is a group from a town that was rated highest quality water in the United States, while Group B is from Flint, Michigan, where it was found that lead was in their water supply. 	Group B
