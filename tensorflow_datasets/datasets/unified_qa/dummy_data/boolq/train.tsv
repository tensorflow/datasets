can you buy beer at a grocery store in pa? \n (Alcohol laws of Pennsylvania) Some supermarkets, including Wegmans, Giant Eagle, Giant, and Weis, have begun to sell alcohol within restaurants attached to the main supermarket building, but only under very specific conditions (the restaurant must have a defined separation from the rest of the supermarket, a separate cashier, and seating for at least 30 patrons). Supermarket chain ShopRite has begun to attach Wine and Spirits stores to its stores. For a time, Sheetz obtained a liquor license for a restaurant attached to one of its convenience stores in Altoona. After several debates, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the store must sell beer to in-house customers as well as take-out. The 17th Street store now again sells beer and allows limited in store consumption.	yes

The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae.
