Who is not going through puberty? \n Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Jim and Bob were brothers. Their mom had just bought them both new cloths at the beginning of the school year. This had always last both brothers for the school year but only Jim could wear his old clothes.	Jim
