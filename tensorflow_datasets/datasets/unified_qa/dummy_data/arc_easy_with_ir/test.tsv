Which statement best explains why photosynthesis is the foundation of most food webs? \n (A) Sunlight is the source of energy for nearly all ecosystems. (B) Most ecosystems are found on land instead of in water. (C) Carbon dioxide is more available than other gases. (D) The producers in all ecosystems are plants.\nFor ecosystems, the major source of energy is sunlight, which passes from organism to organism in food webs. photosynthesis and respiration as well as detailed study of ecosystems, producers, consumers and food webs. Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produces their own food. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce their food. Explain photosynthesis and how plant foods are produced. On Earth, the energy source is usually sunlight, as in the enormous food web that is based on photosynthesis. Investigate and explain how energy entering ecosystems as sunlight is transferred by producers into chemical energy through photosynthesis, and that energy then passes from organism to organism in food webs. If there is more carbon dioxide available, this in turn stimulates photosynthesis, which enables plants to fix carbon dioxide at a higher rate. Explain how plants produce food (photosynthesis). Energy Flow ENTERS THROUGH LEAVES SUNLIGHT FOOD WEB HEAT In most ecosystems, photosynthesis is the beginning of the energy flow.	Sunlight is the source of energy for nearly all ecosystems.
