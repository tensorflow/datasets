Wikipedia-based Image Text (WIT) Dataset is a large multimodal multilingual
dataset. WIT is composed of a curated set of 37.6 million entity rich image-text
examples with 11.5 million unique images across 108 Wikipedia languages. Its
size enables WIT to be used as a pretraining dataset for multimodal machine
learning models.
