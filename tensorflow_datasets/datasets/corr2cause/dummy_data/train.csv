"Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 4 variables, A, B, C and D. All the statistical relations among these 4 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. C correlates with D. However, B and D are independent given A. B and D are independent given A and C. C and D are independent given A. C and D are independent given A and B.
Hypothesis: A directly affects B.",0
