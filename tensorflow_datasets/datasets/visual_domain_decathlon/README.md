This contains the 10 datasets used in the Visual Domain Decathlon, part of the
PASCAL in Detail Workshop Challenge (CVPR 2017). The goal of this challenge is
to solve simultaneously ten image classification problems representative of very
different visual domains.

Some of the datasets included here are also available as separate datasets in
TFDS. However, notice that images were preprocessed for the Visual Domain
Decathlon (resized isotropically to have a shorter size of 72 pixels) and might
have different train/validation/test splits. Here we use the official splits for
the competition.
