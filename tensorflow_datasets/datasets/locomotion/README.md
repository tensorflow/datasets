The datasets were created with a SAC agent trained on the environment reward of
MuJoCo locomotion tasks. These datasets are used in
[What Matters for Adversarial Imitation Learning? Orsini et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00672.pdf).

The datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)
to represent steps and episodes.s
