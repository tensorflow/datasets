WikiDialog is a large dataset of synthetically generated information-seeking
conversations. Each conversation in the dataset contains two speakers grounded
in a passage from English Wikipedia: one speakerâ€™s utterances consist of exact
sentences from the passage; the other speaker is generated by a large language
model.
