This is a public domain speech dataset consisting of 13,100 short audio clips of
a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books. A transcription is
provided for each clip. Clips vary in length from 1 to 10 seconds and have a
total length of approximately 24 hours.

The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain.
The audio was recorded in 2016-17 by the LibriVox project and is also in the
public domain.
