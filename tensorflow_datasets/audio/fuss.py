_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Free Universal Sound Separation (FUSS) Dataset is a database of arbitrary
sound mixtures and source-level references, for use in experiments on arbitrary
sound separation.

This is the official sound separation data for the DCASE2020 Challenge Task 4:
Sound Event Detection and Separation in Domestic Environments.

Overview: FUSS audio data is sourced from a pre-release of Freesound dataset
known as (FSD50k), a sound event dataset composed of Freesound content annotated
with labels from the AudioSet Ontology. Using the FSD50K labels, these source
files have been screened such that they likely only contain a single type of
sound. Labels are not provided for these source files, and are not considered
part of the challenge. For the purpose of the DCASE Task4 Sound Separation and
Event Detection challenge,  systems should not use FSD50K labels, even though
they may become available upon FSD50K release.

To create mixtures, 10 second clips of sources are convolved with simulated room
impulse responses and added together. Each 10 second mixture contains between
1 and 4 sources. Source files longer than 10 seconds are considered "background"
sources. Every mixture contains one background source, which is active for the
entire duration. We provide: a software recipe to create the dataset, the room
impulse responses, and the original source audio.
