_DESCRIPTION = """
Drug Cardiotoxicity dataset [1-2] is a molecule classification task to detect
cardiotoxicity caused by binding hERG target, a protein associated with heart
beat rhythm. The data covers over 9000 molecules with hERG activity.

Note:

1. The data is split into four splits: train, test-iid, test-ood1, test-ood2.

2. Each molecule in the dataset has 2D graph annotations which is designed to
facilitate graph neural network modeling. Nodes are the atoms of the molecule
and edges are the bonds. Each atom is represented as a vector encoding basic
atom information such as atom type. Similar logic applies to bonds.

3. We include Tanimoto fingerprint distance (to training data) for each molecule
in the test sets to facilitate research on distributional shift in graph domain.

For each example, the features include:
  atoms: a 2D tensor with shape (60, 27) storing node features. Molecules with
    less than 60 atoms are padded with zeros. Each atom has 27 atom features.
  pairs: a 3D tensor with shape (60, 60, 12) storing edge features. Each edge
    has 12 edge features.
  atom_mask: a 1D tensor with shape (60, ) storing node masks. 1 indicates the
    corresponding atom is real, othewise a padded one.
  pair_mask: a 2D tensor with shape (60, 60) storing edge masks. 1 indicates the
    corresponding edge is real, othewise a padded one.
  active: a one-hot vector indicating if the molecule is toxic or not. [0, 1]
    indicates it's toxic, otherwise [1, 0] non-toxic.
