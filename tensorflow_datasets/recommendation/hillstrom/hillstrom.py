_DESCRIPTION = """
This dataset contains 64,000 customers who last purchased within twelve months. The customers were involved in an e-mail test.

1. 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Mens merchandise.
2. 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Womens merchandise.
3. 1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign.

During a period of two weeks following the e-mail campaign, results were tracked.
The task is to tell the world if the Mens or Womens e-mail campaign was successful.
