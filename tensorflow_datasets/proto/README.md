This is the directory with 'proto' files that are used by the datasets.

## Protoc compiler
Proto files have to be compiled with protoc compiler -
for installation instructions, please see `core/proto/install_protoc.sh`

## Proto generation
- `tf_example.proto` and `tf_feature.proto` can be generated by running `build_tf_proto.py`;
- `waymo_dataset.proto` can be generated by manually running protoc compiler.

Please always add both the original .proto and the compiled python version.
