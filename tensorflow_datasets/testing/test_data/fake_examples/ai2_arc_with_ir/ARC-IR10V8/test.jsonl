For rapidly rotating stars, excess flux density decreases slowly with increasing P, whereas for longer P the excess flux density decreases much faster with P. > >BUT, the SUN GRAVITY is much stronger and it makes the planets rotate around >the sun, just like the moon rotates around the EARTH from the EARTH GRAVITY. Instead of days like we know on Earth, the rotation of the planet has little impact on the amount of light that most of the planet receives. The Evidence: Seismic (earthquake) wave observations Earth's mean density Earth's rotational patterns (moments of inertia) Meteorites Meteorites A meteorite is a fragment of asteroid, comet, planet, or moon that have fallen to Earth. An example of planetary rotation that caused astronomers quite a bit of confusion was the planet Mercury. For faster-rotating stars the meridional flow is responsible for the (observed) decrease of the normalized surface differential rotation with increasing angular velocity. One effect of increased amperage in the planetary world, seen by our perception, is probably increased vibration, that is, faster rotation of the planet on its own axis ."}
