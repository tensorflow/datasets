What objects were the most fun to watch as they rolled down the ramp? For example, children get to roll various objects down a ramp, to discover which object rolls best. When asked what they are doing, children say: \"I m trying to see if this big ball can knock the blocks down,\" or, \"I want to see which ball can roll the farthest,\" or, \"I wonder if I can make the ball go up the ramp.\" Students explain why the objects roll down the ramp. If I want my students to understand that a rolling ball can be a force upon another object which would cause that object to move, I can position a block at the bottom of my ramp and ask, \"I wonder what will happen to the block when I roll my ball down the ramp?\" Lecture Demos: Roll different objects down a ramp again. The search for an object that will roll down a ramp for Bunyip s bowling game leads the two characters into an investigation of spheres, circles, and their respective properties. Experiment with balls and other objects to see which will roll down the ramps. Roll different objects down a ramp."}
