All living plant cells survive the night-time and cloudy days by respiration, most of which takes place in the cell's mitochondria. Cellular respiration takes place in the cristae of the mitochondria within cells. It takes place in the cells of both autotrophs and heterotrophs. Intracellular digestion takes place in: a. the intermembrane space of mitochondria. protein synthesis and processing in plant cells. A major metabolic pathway involved in aerobic cellular respiration (energy production) which takes place in the mitochondria of animal and plant cells."}
