john `` jack '' reynolds -lrb- 21 february 1869 -- 12 march 1917 -rrb- was a footballer who played for , among others , west bromwich albion , aston villa and celtic .
as an international he played five times for ireland before it emerged that he was actually english and he subsequently played eight times for england .
he is the only player , barring own goals , to score for and against england and is the only player to play for both ireland and england .
he won the fa cup with west bromwich albion in 1892 and was a prominent member of the successful aston villa team of the 1890s , winning three english league titles and two fa cups , including a double in 1897 .
reynolds was noted as a highly competitive player with some remarkable ball skills and exceptionally brilliant footwork .
he was regarded as one of the great footballers of the 1890s and was one of the highest paid players of his generation .
however he also gained a reputation for drinking and womanising and as result much of the money he earned disappeared .
he fathered at least one illegitimate child and in 1899 he appeared in court for non-payment of child maintenance .
his heavy drinking blighted his latter career and after brief spells at celtic and then southampton , he became a semi-professional journeyman .
towards the end of his life he worked as a miner in sheffield and he died alone in a boarding house at the age of 48 .
reynolds and his career have been the subject of several lectures , including one entitled `` how to play football , win friends and die young : the life of john reynolds '' , given by dr. neal garnham at the university of ulster .
