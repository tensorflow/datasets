So this means that the creatures of Area 18 have fallen, right?
Sorry, I'll have you accompany me in finishing it. No need. Your section has been secured.
Area 11 will be difficult to handle.
I will find you, Zero... to avenge Clovis!
I'm home.
Welcome home, Lelouch.
Welcome home, brother.
From the looks of it, you've already ate dinner.
I was worried.
I thought that you might have been caught up in the chaos that person named Zero caused.
I called you, but I couldn't reach you.
Brother?
