highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.<br><b>Sent 3: </b>But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \"gun rights\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.<br><b>Sent 4: </b>Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people?<br><b>Sent 5: </b>I highly doubt it.<br><b>Sent 6: </b>But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.<br><b>Sent 7: </b>This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics.<br><b>Sent 8: </b>Buell shooting in Flint.<br><b>Sent 9: </b>You write: \"Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before\".<br><b>Sent 10: </b>This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against.<br><b>Sent 11: </b>It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.<br><b>Sent 12: </b>The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed.<br><b>Sent 13: </b>But why do people deal with drugs?<br><b>Sent 14: </b>Because it's so much fun to do so?<br><b>Sent 15: </b>It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American \"contras\" It is equally well known that the so-called \"war on drugs\" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in
