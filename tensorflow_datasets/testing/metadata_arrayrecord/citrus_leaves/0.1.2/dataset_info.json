  "description": "The original citrus dataset contains 759 images of healthy and unhealthy citrus\nfruits and leaves. However, for now we only export 594 images of citrus leaves\nwith the following labels: Black Spot, Canker, Greening, and Healthy. The\nexported images are in PNG format and have 256x256 pixels.\n\nNOTE: Leaf images with Melanose label were dropped due to very small count and\nother non-leaf images being present in the same directory.\n\nDataset URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3f83gxmv57/2\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0",
