  "description": "The CIFAR-10.1 dataset is a new test set for CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10.1 contains roughly 2,000 new test images \nthat were sampled after multiple years of research on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. The data collection \nfor CIFAR-10.1 was designed to minimize distribution shift relative to the original dataset. We describe \nthe creation of CIFAR-10.1 in the paper \"Do CIFAR-10 Classifiers Generalize to CIFAR-10?\". \nThe images in CIFAR-10.1 are a subset of the TinyImages dataset. \nThere are currently two versions of the CIFAR-10.1 dataset: v4 and v6.",
