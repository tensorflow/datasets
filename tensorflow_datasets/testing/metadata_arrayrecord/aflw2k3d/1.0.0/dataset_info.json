  "description": "AFLW2000-3D is a dataset of 2000 images that have been annotated with image-level\n68-point 3D facial landmarks.\nThis dataset is typically used for evaluation of 3D facial landmark detection\nmodels. The head poses are very diverse and often hard to be detected by a \ncnn-based face detector.\nThe 2D landmarks are skipped in this dataset, since some of the data are not\nconsistent to 21 points, as the original paper mentioned.",
