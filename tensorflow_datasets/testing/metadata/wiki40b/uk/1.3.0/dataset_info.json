  "description": "Clean-up text for 40+ Wikipedia languages editions of pages\ncorrespond to entities. The datasets have train/dev/test splits per language.\nThe dataset is cleaned up by page filtering to remove disambiguation pages,\nredirect pages, deleted pages, and non-entity pages. Each example contains the\nwikidata id of the entity, and the full Wikipedia article after page processing\nthat removes non-content sections and structured objects. The language models\ntrained on this corpus - including 41 monolingual models, and 2 multilingual\nmodels - can be found at https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/wiki40b-lm/1.",
