  "configDescription": "The Choice Of Plausible Alternatives (COPA, Roemmele et al., 2011) dataset is a causal\nreasoning task in which a system is given a premise sentence and two possible alternatives. The\nsystem must choose the alternative which has the more plausible causal relationship with the premise.\nThe method used for the construction of the alternatives ensures that the task requires causal reasoning\nto solve. Examples either deal with alternative possible causes or alternative possible effects of the\npremise sentence, accompanied by a simple question disambiguating between the two instance\ntypes for the model. All examples are handcrafted and focus on topics from online blogs and a\nphotography-related encyclopedia. Following the recommendation of the authors, we evaluate using\naccuracy.",
