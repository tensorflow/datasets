  "configDescription": "The Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension dataset (MultiRC, Khashabi et al., 2018)\nis a true/false question-answering task. Each example consists of a context paragraph, a question\nabout that paragraph, and a list of possible answers to that question which must be labeled as true or\nfalse. Question-answering (QA) is a popular problem with many datasets. We use MultiRC because\nof a number of desirable properties: (i) each question can have multiple possible correct answers,\nso each question-answer pair must be evaluated independent of other pairs, (ii) the questions are\ndesigned such that answering each question requires drawing facts from multiple context sentences,\nand (iii) the question-answer pair format more closely matches the API of other SuperGLUE tasks\nthan span-based extractive QA does. The paragraphs are drawn from seven domains including news,\nfiction, and historical text.",
