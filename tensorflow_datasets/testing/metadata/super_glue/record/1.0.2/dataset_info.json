  "configDescription": "(Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning Dataset, Zhang et al., 2018) is a\nmultiple-choice QA task. Each example consists of a news article and a Cloze-style question about\nthe article in which one entity is masked out. The system must predict the masked out entity from a\ngiven list of possible entities in the provided passage, where the same entity may be expressed using\nmultiple different surface forms, all of which are considered correct. Articles are drawn from CNN\nand Daily Mail. Following the original work, we evaluate with max (over all mentions) token-level\nF1 and exact match (EM).",
