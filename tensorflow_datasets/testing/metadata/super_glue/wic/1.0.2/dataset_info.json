Given two sentences and a\npolysemous (sense-ambiguous) word that appears in both sentences, the task is to determine whether\nthe word is used with the same sense in both sentences. Sentences are drawn from WordNet (Miller,\n1995), VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and Wiktionary. We follow the original work and evaluate using\naccuracy.",
