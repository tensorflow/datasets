  "configDescription": "The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) datasets come from a series of annual competitions\non textual entailment, the problem of predicting whether a given premise sentence entails a given\nhypothesis sentence (also known as natural language inference, NLI). RTE was previously included\nin GLUE, and we use the same data and format as before: We merge data from RTE1 (Dagan\net al., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and RTE5 (Bentivogli\net al., 2009). All datasets are combined and converted to two-class classification: entailment and\nnot_entailment. Of all the GLUE tasks, RTE was among those that benefited from transfer learning\nthe most, jumping from near random-chance performance (~56%) at the time of GLUE's launch to\n85% accuracy (Liu et al., 2019c) at the time of writing. Given the eight point gap with respect to\nhuman performance, however, the task is not yet solved by machines, and we expect the remaining\ngap to be difficult to close.",
