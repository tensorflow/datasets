  "description": "The Robomimic mixed human datasets were collected by several mixed-ability\noperators using the [RoboTurk](https://roboturk.stanford.edu/) platform.\nEach dataset consists of 200 demonstrations.\n\nEach task has two versions: one with low dimensional observations (`low_dim`),\nand one with images (`image`).\n\nThe datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)\nto represent steps and episodes.",
