  "description": "MC-TACO is a dataset of 13k question-answer pairs that require temporal\ncommonsense comprehension. The dataset contains five temporal properties:\n\n1. duration (how long an event takes)\n2. temporal ordering (typical order of events)\n3. typical time (when an event occurs)\n4. frequency (how often an event occurs)\n5. stationarity (whether a state is maintained for a very long time or indefinitely)\n\nWe hope that this dataset can promote the future exploration of this\n particular class of reasoning problems.",
