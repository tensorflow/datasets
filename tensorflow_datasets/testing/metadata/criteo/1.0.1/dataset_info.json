  "description": "# Criteo Uplift Modeling Dataset\nThis dataset is released along with the paper:\n\u201cA Large Scale Benchmark for Uplift Modeling\u201d\nEustache Diemert, Artem Betlei, Christophe Renaudin; (Criteo AI Lab), Massih-Reza Amini (LIG, Grenoble INP)\n\nThis work was published in: AdKDD 2018 Workshop, in conjunction with KDD 2018.\n\n### Data description\nThis dataset is constructed by assembling data resulting from several incrementality tests, a particular randomized trial procedure where a random part of the population is prevented from being targeted by advertising. it consists of 25M rows, each one representing a user with 11 features, a treatment indicator and 2 labels (visits and conversions).\n\n### Fields\nHere is a detailed description of the fields (they are comma-separated in the file):\n\n- f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11: feature values (dense, float)\n- treatment: treatment group (1 = treated, 0 = control)\n- conversion: whether a conversion occured for this user (binary, label)\n- visit: whether a visit occured for this user (binary, label)\n- exposure: treatment effect, whether the user has been effectively exposed (binary)\n\n### Key figures\n\n- Format: CSV\n- Size: 459MB (compressed)\n- Rows: 25,309,483\n- Average Visit Rate: .04132\n- Average Conversion Rate: .00229\n- Treatment Ratio: .846\n\n### Tasks\n\nThe dataset was collected and prepared with uplift prediction in mind as the main task. Additionally we can foresee related usages such as but not limited to:\n\n- benchmark for causal inference\n- uplift modeling\n- interactions between features and treatment\n- heterogeneity of treatment\n- benchmark for observational causality methods",
