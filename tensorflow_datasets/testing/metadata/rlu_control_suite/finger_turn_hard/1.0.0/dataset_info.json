  "description": "RL Unplugged is suite of benchmarks for offline reinforcement learning. The RL\nUnplugged is designed around the following considerations: to facilitate ease of\nuse, we provide the datasets with a unified API which makes it easy for the\npractitioner to work with all data in the suite once a general pipeline has been\nestablished.\n\nThe datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)\nto represent steps and episodes.\n\n\nDeepMind Control Suite [Tassa et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690)\nis a set of control tasks implemented in MuJoCo\n[Todorov et al., 2012](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/TodorovIROS12.pdf).\nWe consider a subset of the tasks provided in the suite that cover a wide range\nof difficulties.\n\nMost of the datasets in this domain are generated using D4PG. For the\nenvironments Manipulator insert ball and Manipulator insert peg we use V-MPO\n[Song et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12238) to generate the data as\nD4PG is unable to solve these tasks. We release datasets for 9 control suite\ntasks. For details on how the dataset was generated, please refer to the paper.\n\nDeepMind Control Suite is a traditional continuous action RL benchmark.\nIn particular, we recommend you test your approach in DeepMind Control Suite if\nyou are interested in comparing against other state of the art offline RL\nmethods.",
