  "description": "The Proficient Human datasets were collected by 1 proficient operator using the\n[RoboTurk](https://roboturk.stanford.edu/) platform (with the exception of\nTransport, which had 2 proficient operators working together). Each dataset\nconsists of 200 successful trajectories.\n\nEach task has two versions: one with low dimensional observations (`low_dim`),\nand one with images (`image`).\n\nThe datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)\nto represent steps and episodes.",
