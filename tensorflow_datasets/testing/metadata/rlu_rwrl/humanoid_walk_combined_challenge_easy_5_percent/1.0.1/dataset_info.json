  "description": "RL Unplugged is suite of benchmarks for offline reinforcement learning. The RL\nUnplugged is designed around the following considerations: to facilitate ease of\nuse, we provide the datasets with a unified API which makes it easy for the\npractitioner to work with all data in the suite once a general pipeline has been\nestablished.\n\nThe datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)\nto represent steps and episodes.\n\n\nExamples in the dataset represent SAR transitions stored when running a\npartially online trained agent as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12901.\nWe follow the RLDS dataset format, as specified in\nhttps://github.com/google-research/rlds#dataset-format.\n\n\nWe release 40 datasets on 8 tasks in total -- with no combined challenge and\neasy combined challenge on the cartpole, walker, quadruped, and humanoid tasks.\nEach task contains 5 different sizes of datasets, 1%, 5%, 20%, 40%, and 100%.\nNote that the smaller dataset is not guaranteed to be a subset of the larger\nones. For details on how the dataset was generated, please refer to the paper.",
