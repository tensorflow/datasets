  "description": "XQuAD (Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset) is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-lingual question answering performance. The dataset consists of a subset of 240 paragraphs and 1190 question-answer pairs from the development set of SQuAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) together with their professional translations into ten languages: Spanish, German, Greek, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, and Hindi. Consequently, the dataset is entirely parallel across 11 languages. To run XQuAD in the default zero-shot setting, use the SQuAD v1.1 training and validation data here: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/squad\n\nWe also include \"translate-train\", \"translate-dev\", and \"translate-test\" splits for each non-English language from XTREME (Hu et al., 2020). These can be used to run XQuAD in the \"translate-train\" or \"translate-test\" settings.",
