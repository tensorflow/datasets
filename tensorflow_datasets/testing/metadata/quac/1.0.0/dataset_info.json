  "description": "Question Answering in Context is a dataset for modeling, understanding,\nand participating in information seeking dialog. Data instances consist\nof an interactive dialog between two crowd workers: (1) a student who poses\na sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden\nWikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing\nshort excerpts (spans) from the text. QuAC introduces challenges not found\nin existing machine comprehension datasets: its questions are often more\nopen-ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context.",
