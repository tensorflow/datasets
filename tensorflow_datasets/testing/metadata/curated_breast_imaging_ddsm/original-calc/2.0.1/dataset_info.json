  "description": "The CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM) is an updated and\nstandardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM).\nThe DDSM is a database of 2,620 scanned film mammography studies.\nIt contains normal, benign, and malignant cases with verified pathology\ninformation.\n\nThe default config is made of patches extracted from the original mammograms,\nfollowing the description from http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09427, in order to\nframe the task to solve in a traditional image classification setting.\n\nBecause special software and libraries are needed to download and read the\nimages contained in the dataset, TFDS assumes that the user has downloaded the\noriginal DCIM files and converted them to PNG.\n\nThe following commands (or equivalent) should be used to generate the PNG files,\nin order to guarantee reproducible results:\n\n```\n  find $DATASET_DCIM_DIR -name '*.dcm' | \\\n  xargs -n1 -P8 -I{} bash -c 'f={}; dcmj2pnm $f | convert - ${f/.dcm/.png}'\n```",
