  "description": "WikiAuto provides a set of aligned sentences from English Wikipedia and\nSimple English Wikipedia as a resource to train sentence simplification\nsystems. The authors first crowd-sourced a set of manual alignments between\nsentences in a subset of the Simple English Wikipedia and their corresponding\nversions in English Wikipedia (this corresponds to the `manual` config),\nthen trained a neural CRF system to predict these alignments. The trained\nmodel was then applied to the other articles in Simple English Wikipedia\nwith an English counterpart to create a larger corpus of aligned sentences\n(corresponding to the `auto`, `auto_acl`, `auto_full_no_split`, and\n`auto_full_with_split` configs here).",
