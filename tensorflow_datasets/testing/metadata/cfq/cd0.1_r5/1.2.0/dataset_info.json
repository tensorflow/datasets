  "description": "The CFQ dataset (and it's splits) for measuring compositional generalization.\n\nSee https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09713.pdf for background.\n\nA note about the validation set: Since it has the same distribution as the test\nset and we are interested in measuring the compositional generalization of a\n*model* with respect to an *unknown* test distribution we suggest that any\ntuning should be done on a subset of the train set only (see section 5.1 of the\npaper).\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ndata = tfds.load('cfq/mcd1')\n```",
