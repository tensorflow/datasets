  "description": "Imagewang contains Imagenette and Imagewoof combined\nImage\u7f51 (pronounced \"Imagewang\"; \u7f51 means \"net\" in Chinese) contains Imagenette\nand Imagewoof combined, but with some twists that make it into a tricky\nsemi-supervised unbalanced classification problem:\n\n* The validation set is the same as Imagewoof (i.e. 30% of Imagewoof images);\n  there are no Imagenette images in the validation set (they're all in the\n  training set)\n* Only 10% of Imagewoof images are in the training set!\n* The remaining are in the unsup (\"unsupervised\") directory, and you can not\n  use their labels in training!\n* It's even hard to type and hard to say!\n\nThe dataset comes in three variants:\n\n  * Full size\n  * 320 px\n  * 160 px\n\nThis dataset consists of the Imagenette dataset {size} variant.",
