In this paper, we show the impact of semantic noise on state-of-the-art NNLG models which implement different semantic control mechanisms. We find that cleaned data can improve semantic correctness by up to 97{\\%}, while maintaining fluency. We also find that the most common error is omitting information, rather than hallucination.\",\n}",
