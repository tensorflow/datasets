  "description": "This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition\nliterature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced\nfrequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains\n3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris\nplant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT\nlinearly separable from each other.\n",
