  "description": "A new dataset of 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science\nquestions, assembled to encourage research in advanced question-answering.\nThe dataset is partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set, where the\nformer contains only questions answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based\nalgorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. We are also including a corpus\nof over 14 million science sentences relevant to the task, and an\nimplementation of three neural baseline models for this dataset.\nWe pose ARC as a challenge to the community.",
