  "description": "A new dataset of 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science \n questions, assembled to encourage research in advanced question-answering. \n The dataset is partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set, where the \n former contains only questions answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based\n algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. We are also including a corpus\n of over 14 million science sentences relevant to the task, and an \n implementation of three neural baseline models for this dataset.\n We pose ARC as a challenge to the community.",
