  "description": "ImageNet-A is a set of images labelled with ImageNet labels that were obtained\nby collecting new data and keeping only those images that ResNet-50 models fail\nto correctly classify. For more details please refer to the paper.\n\nThe label space is the same as that of ImageNet2012. Each example is\nrepresented as a dictionary with the following keys:\n\n* 'image': The image, a (H, W, 3)-tensor.\n* 'label': An integer in the range [0, 1000).\n* 'file_name': A unique sting identifying the example within the dataset.",
