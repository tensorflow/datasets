  "configDescription": "MultiRC is a reading comprehension challenge in which questions can\nonly be answered by taking into account information from multiple\nsentences. Questions and answers for this challenge were solicited and\nverified through a 4-step crowdsourcing experiment. The dataset\ncontains questions for paragraphs across 7 different domains (\nelementary school science, news, travel guides, fiction stories, etc)\nbringing in linguistic diversity to the texts and to the questions\nwordings.\n",
  "configName": "multirc",
  "description": "The UnifiedQA benchmark consists of 20 main question answering (QA) datasets\n(each may have multiple versions) that target different formats as well as\nvarious complex linguistic phenomena. These datasets are grouped into several\nformats/categories, including: extractive QA, abstractive QA, multiple-choice\nQA, and yes/no QA. Additionally, contrast sets are used for several datasets\n(denoted with \"contrast_sets_\"). These evaluation sets are expert-generated\nperturbations that deviate from the patterns common in the original dataset. For\nseveral datasets that do not come with evidence paragraphs, two variants are\nincluded: one where the datasets are used as-is and another that uses paragraphs\nfetched via an information retrieval system as additional evidence, indicated\nwith \"_ir\" tags.\n\nMore information can be found at: https://github.com/allenai/unifiedqa.",
