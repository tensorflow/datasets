  "configDescription": "MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading\ncomprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the\nhigh-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading\ncomprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and\nunderstanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide\na clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found\nonly in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully\nlimited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world\nknowledge that is required for the task.\n",

  "description": "The UnifiedQA benchmark consists of 20 main question answering (QA) datasets\n(each may have multiple versions) that target different formats as well as\nvarious complex linguistic phenomena. These datasets are grouped into several\nformats/categories, including: extractive QA, abstractive QA, multiple-choice\nQA, and yes/no QA. Additionally, contrast sets are used for several datasets\n(denoted with \"contrast_sets_\"). These evaluation sets are expert-generated\nperturbations that deviate from the patterns common in the original dataset. For\nseveral datasets that do not come with evidence paragraphs, two variants are\nincluded: one where the datasets are used as-is and another that uses paragraphs\nfetched via an information retrieval system as additional evidence, indicated\nwith \"_ir\" tags.\n\nMore information can be found at: https://github.com/allenai/unifiedqa.",
