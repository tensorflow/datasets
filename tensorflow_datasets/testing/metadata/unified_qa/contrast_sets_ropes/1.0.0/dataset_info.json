  "configDescription": "This dataset tests a system's ability to apply knowledge from a\npassage of text to a new situation. A system is presented a background\npassage containing a causal or qualitative relation(s) (e.g., \"animal\npollinators increase efficiency of fertilization in flowers\"), a novel\nsituation that uses this background, and questions that require\nreasoning about effects of the relationships in the background passage\nin the context of the situation. This version uses contrast sets.\nThese evaluation sets are expert-generated perturbations that deviate\nfrom the patterns common in the original dataset.\n",

  "description": "The UnifiedQA benchmark consists of 20 main question answering (QA) datasets\n(each may have multiple versions) that target different formats as well as\nvarious complex linguistic phenomena. These datasets are grouped into several\nformats/categories, including: extractive QA, abstractive QA, multiple-choice\nQA, and yes/no QA. Additionally, contrast sets are used for several datasets\n(denoted with \"contrast_sets_\"). These evaluation sets are expert-generated\nperturbations that deviate from the patterns common in the original dataset. For\nseveral datasets that do not come with evidence paragraphs, two variants are\nincluded: one where the datasets are used as-is and another that uses paragraphs\nfetched via an information retrieval system as additional evidence, indicated\nwith \"_ir\" tags.\n\nMore information can be found at: https://github.com/allenai/unifiedqa.",
