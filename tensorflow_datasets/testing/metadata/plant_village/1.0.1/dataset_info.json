  "description": "The PlantVillage dataset consists of 54303 healthy and unhealthy leaf images\ndivided into 38 categories by species and disease.\n\nNOTE: The original dataset is not available from the original source\n(plantvillage.org), therefore we get the unaugmented dataset from a paper that\nused that dataset and republished it. Moreover, we dropped images with\nBackground_without_leaves label, because these were not present in the original\ndataset.\n\nOriginal paper URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08060\nDataset URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1",
