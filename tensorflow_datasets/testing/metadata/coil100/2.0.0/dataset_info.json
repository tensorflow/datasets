  "description": "The dataset contains 7200 color images of 100 objects\n(72 images per object). The objects have a wide variety of complex geometric and reflectance characteristics.\nThe objects were placed on a motorized turntable against a black background.\nThe turntable was rotated through 360 degrees to vary object pose with respect to a fxed color camera.\nImages of the objects were taken at pose intervals of\t5 degrees.This corresponds to\n72 poses per object",
