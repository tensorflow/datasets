While non-English NLG is under-explored in general, Czech, as a morphologically rich language, makes the task even harder: Since Czech requires inflecting named entities, delexicalization or copy mechanisms do not work out-of-the-box and lexicalizing the generated outputs is non-trivial. In our experiments, we present two different approaches to this this problem: (1) using a neural language model to select the correct inflected form while lexicalizing, (2) a two-step generation setup: our sequence-to-sequence model generates an interleaved sequence of lemmas and morphological tags, which are then inflected by a morphological generator.},\n}",

The input meaning representations\ncontain a dialogue act type (inform, confirm etc.), slots (food, area, etc.) and their values.\nIt originated as a translation of the English San Francisco Restaurants dataset by Wen et al.
