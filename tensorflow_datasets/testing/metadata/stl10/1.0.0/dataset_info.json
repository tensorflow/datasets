  "description": "The STL-10 dataset is an image recognition dataset for developing unsupervised\nfeature learning, deep learning, self-taught learning algorithms. It is inspired\nby the CIFAR-10 dataset but with some modifications. In particular, each class\nhas fewer labeled training examples than in CIFAR-10, but a very large set of \nunlabeled examples is provided to learn image models prior to supervised\ntraining. The primary challenge is to make use of the unlabeled data (which\ncomes from a similar but different distribution from the labeled data) to build\na useful prior. All images were acquired from labeled examples on ImageNet.",
