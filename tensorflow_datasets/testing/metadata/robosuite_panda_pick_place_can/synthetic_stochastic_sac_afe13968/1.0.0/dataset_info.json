  "description": "These datasets have been created with the PickPlaceCan environment of the\n[robosuite robotic arm simulator](https://robosuite.ai/). The human datasets\nwere recorded by a single operator using\nthe [RLDS Creator](https://github.com/google-research/rlds-creator) and a\ngamepad controller.\n\nThe synthetic datasets have been recorded using the\n[EnvLogger library](https://github.com/deepmind/envlogger).\n\nThe datasets follow the [RLDS format](https://github.com/google-research/rlds)\nto represent steps and episodes.\n\nEpisodes consist of 400 steps. In each episode, a tag is\nadded when the task is completed, this tag is stored as part of the custom step\nmetadata.\n\nNote that, due to the EnvLogger dependency, generation of this dataset is\ncurrently supported on Linux environments only.",
