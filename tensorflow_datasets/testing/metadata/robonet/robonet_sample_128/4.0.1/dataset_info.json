  "description": "RoboNet contains over 15 million video frames of robot-object\ninteraction, taken from 113 unique camera viewpoints.\n\n* The actions are deltas in position and rotation to the robot\nend-effector with one additional dimension of the action vector\nreserved for the gripper joint.\n\n* The states are cartesian end-effector control action space\nwith restricted rotation, and a gripper joint",
