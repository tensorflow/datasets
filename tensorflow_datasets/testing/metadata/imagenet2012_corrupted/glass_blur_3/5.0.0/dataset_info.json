{"name":"imagenet2012_corrupted","description":"Imagenet2012Corrupted is a dataset generated by adding common corruptions to the\nimages in the ImageNet dataset. In the original paper, there are 15 + 4\ndifferent corruptions, and each has 5 levels of severity. We also implement the 4 extra\ncorruptions gaussian blur, saturate, spatter, and speckle noise. The randomness\nis fixed so that regeneration is deterministic.","citation":"@inproceedings{\n  hendrycks2018benchmarking,\n  title={Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations},\n  author={Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2019},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJz6tiCqYm},\n}","location":{"urls":["https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJz6tiCqYm"]},"splits":[{"name":"validation","shardLengths":["6250","6250","6250","6250","6250","6250","6250","6250"],"numBytes":"747787901"}],"supervisedKeys":{"input":"image","output":"label"},"version":"5.0.0","downloadSize":"2080003","configName":"glass_blur_3","configDescription":"corruption type = glass_blur, severity = 3","fileFormat":"array_record"}
