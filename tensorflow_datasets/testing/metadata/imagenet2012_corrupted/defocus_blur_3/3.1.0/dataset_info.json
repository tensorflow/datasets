{"name":"imagenet2012_corrupted","description":"Imagenet2012Corrupted is a dataset generated by adding common corruptions to the\nimages in the ImageNet dataset. In the original paper, there are 15 + 4\ndifferent corruptions, and each has 5 levels of severity. We also implement the 4 extra\ncorruptions gaussian blur, saturate, spatter, and speckle noise. The randomness\nis fixed so that regeneration is deterministic.\n","citation":"@inproceedings{\n  hendrycks2018benchmarking,\n  title={Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations},\n  author={Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2019},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJz6tiCqYm},\n}\n","sizeInBytes":"2080003","location":{"urls":["https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJz6tiCqYm"]},"schema":{"feature":[{"name":"file_name","type":"BYTES"},{"name":"image","type":"INT","shape":{"dim":[{"size":"224"},{"size":"224"},{"size":"3"}]}},{"name":"label","type":"INT"}]},"splits":[{"name":"validation","numShards":"5","statistics":{"numExamples":"50000","features":[{"name":"file_name","type":"BYTES","bytesStats":{"commonStats":{"numNonMissing":"50000"}}},{"name":"image","numStats":{"commonStats":{"numNonMissing":"50000"},"max":255}},{"name":"label","numStats":{"commonStats":{"numNonMissing":"50000"},"max":999}}]},"shardLengths":["12500","12500","12500","12500"]}],"supervisedKeys":{"input":"image","output":"label"},"version":"3.1.0","fileFormat":"array_record"}
