  "description": "Imagenet2012Corrupted is a dataset generated by adding common corruptions to the\nimages in the ImageNet dataset. In the original paper, there are 15 + 4\ndifferent corruptions, and each has 5 levels of severity. We also implement the 4 extra\ncorruptions gaussian blur, saturate, spatter, and speckle noise. The randomness\nis fixed so that regeneration is deterministic.",
