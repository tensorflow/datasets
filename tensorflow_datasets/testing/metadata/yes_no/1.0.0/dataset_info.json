  "description": "Sixty recordings of one individual saying yes or no in Hebrew; each recording is eight words long.\n\nThe main point of the dataset is to provide an easy and fast way to test out the Kaldi scripts for free.\n\nThe archive \"waves_yesno.tar.gz\" contains 60 .wav files, sampled at 8 kHz.\nAll were recorded by the same male speaker, in Hebrew.\nIn each file, the individual says 8 words; each word is either the Hebrew for \"yes\" or \"no\",\nso each file is a random sequence of 8 yes-es or noes.\nThere is no separate transcription provided; the sequence is encoded in the filename, with 1 for yes and 0 for no.",
