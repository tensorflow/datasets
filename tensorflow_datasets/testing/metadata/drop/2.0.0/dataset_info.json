  "description": "With system performance on existing reading comprehension benchmarks nearing or\nsurpassing human performance, we need a new, hard dataset that improves systems'\ncapabilities to actually read paragraphs of text. DROP is a crowdsourced,\nadversarially-created, 96k-question benchmark, in which a system must resolve\nreferences in a question, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform\ndiscrete operations over them (such as addition, counting, or sorting). These\noperations require a much more comprehensive understanding of the content of\nparagraphs than what was necessary for prior datasets.",
