  "description": "Caltech-101 consists of pictures of objects belonging to 101 classes, plus\none `background clutter` class. Each image is labelled with a single object.\nEach class contains roughly 40 to 800 images, totalling around 9k images.\nImages are of variable sizes, with typical edge lengths of 200-300 pixels.\nThis version contains image-level labels only. The original dataset also\ncontains bounding boxes.",
