  "description": "3dshapes is a dataset of 3D shapes procedurally generated from 6 ground truth\nindependent latent factors. These factors are *floor colour*, *wall colour*, *object colour*,\n*scale*, *shape* and *orientation*.\n\nAll possible combinations of these latents are present exactly once, generating N = 480000 total images.\n\n### Latent factor values\n\n*   floor hue: 10 values linearly spaced in [0, 1]\n*   wall hue: 10 values linearly spaced in [0, 1]\n*   object hue: 10 values linearly spaced in [0, 1]\n*   scale: 8 values linearly spaced in [0, 1]\n*   shape: 4 values in [0, 1, 2, 3]\n*   orientation: 15 values linearly spaced in [-30, 30]\n\nWe varied one latent at a time (starting from orientation, then shape, etc), and sequentially stored the images in fixed order in the `images` array. The corresponding values of the factors are stored in the same order in the `labels` array.",
