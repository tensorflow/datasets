The author of this dataset states that \"I'm hosting them because it seems like nobody else does (hopefully it isn't because hosting them is illegal :)). Naturally, I'm not the one who stole these; I simply found them online, removed any names/email addresses/etc.\". This dataset is used to train Machine Learning models for password guessing and cracking.\n",
