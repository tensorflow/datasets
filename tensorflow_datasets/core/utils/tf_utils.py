  """Run in session mode or Eager mode.

  This is a compatibility util between graph and eager TensorFlow.

  The graph runner allow to run function defining small TensorFlow graphs:
   * In eager mode: The function is simply run eagerly and the result is
     returned
   * In graph mode: The first time, the function is compiled in a new graph,
     then, every time the same function will be called, the cached graph and
     session will be run.

  Ideally, one graph runner should only be used with a single function to avoid
  having too many opened session in session mode.
  Limitations:
   * Currently the graph runner only support function with single input
     and output. Support for more complex function could be added and should be
     relatively straightforward.
   * A different graph is created for each input shape, so it isn't really
     adapted for dynamic batch size.

  Usage:
    graph_runner = TFGraphRunner()
    output = graph_runner.run(tf.sigmoid, np.ones(shape=(5,)))
