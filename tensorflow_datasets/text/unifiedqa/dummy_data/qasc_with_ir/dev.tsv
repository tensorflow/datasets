Climate is generally described in terms of what? \n (A) sand (B) occurs over a wide range (C) forests (D) Global warming (E) rapid changes occur (F) local weather conditions (G) measure of motion (H) city life\nTemperature is a measure of the motion of molecules. Tropical palm trees poke out of the sand everywhere. Fire behavior is driven by local weather conditions such as winds, temperature and moisture. Temperature is a measure of molecular motion. Decomposition occurs rapidly in warm temperatures. Temperature, moisture, and day length affect the life cycles of plants, insects, and other animals. For a general introduction to the characters, see the Introduction . Mangrove forests are intertidal coastal forests of tropical and sub-tropical regions. Seeds germinate under a wide range of temperatures as long as there is sufficient moisture. Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture. Temperature and moisture are the primary factors controlling the flea life cycle. When moisture in the sand freezes, a crust on the surface of the sand is created. Temperatures are retrieved of global atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles. Tropical forest bryophytes. Moisture, temperature and barn environment all have affects on the life expectancy of the pads. Introduction to Climate Introduction Climate is the average weather conditions. Spring and fall can have widely ranging temperatures and moisture conditions. Global warming is the change of the Earth's temperature. Temperature Temperature is a measure for the motional energy of the atoms. Infection occurs over a wide range of soil moisture levels. Rapid changes in global temperatures have occurred in the past 30 years. Tropical forests are dynamic. Tillers require warm temperatures and adequate moisture. S ub-tropical to tropical, describes the climate generally. Rapid temperature changes and spontaneous storms do occur.	local weather conditions
