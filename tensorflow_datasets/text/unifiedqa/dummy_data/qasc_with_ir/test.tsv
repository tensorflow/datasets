What type of birth do therian mammals have? \n (A) Anthax (B) under water (C) uterus (D) wombs (E) two (F) moles (G) live (H) embryo\nWhale sharks are viviparous , giving birth to live young. Moles that appear at birth are called congenital nevi. Water deficit induces abscisic acid accumulation in endosperm of maize viviparous mutants. Mammals that are viviparous are called therian mammals. Placental Mammals Placental mammals have wombs. Sometimes, moles called nevi appear after birth, and they're no problem. Placental abruption is often associated with bleeding and premature birth. Placental mammals are therian mammals in which a placenta develops during pregnancy. Some cells develop into the embryo and some cells develop into the placenta. Birth control pills use two types of hormones, progesterone and estrogen, to prevent pregnancy. If moles become cancerous, they are called melanomans. Viviparous sharks give birth to live young. All non-identical pregnancies have two placentas and two sacs. With placental abruption, the placenta prematurely separates from the uterus. Viviparous sharks form a placental from the embryo to the oviduct wall. Another dissolved substance in ocean water is a type of rock called limestone . Placental abruption is the early separation of a normal placenta from the wall of the uterus. Blennius, silures, and others bring forth living young, and are called viviparous. Placenta previa is a condition in pregnancy in which the placenta lies below the baby in the uterus. An attraction between dissimilar types of molecules, such as glass and water, is called adhesion. Placentation Types Placentation refers to the pattern of attachment of ovules within the ovary.	-
