Are the motions of objects in outer space explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation? \n    Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal.    That means gravity affects all objects in the universe.    Thats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation.    Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way.    This is the reason the apple falling from the tree and the Moon being held in orbit is the same.    Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth.    In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you.    Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.    Newtons law had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe.    It explains the motion of objects not only on Earth but in outer space as well. 	yes
