Which factor will most likely cause a person to develop a fever? \n (A) a leg muscle relaxing after exercise (B) a bacterial population in the bloodstream (C) several viral particles on the skin (D) carbohydrates being digested in the stomach\nYellow fever or "breakbone" fever, a severe flu-like viral illness that can cause fatal internal bleeding, is also spreading. It is also the most common cause of bacterial bloodstream infections in children. bacterial meningitis Causes, incidence, and risk factors The most common causes of meningitis are bacterial infections that start in other parts of the body and spread to the brain or spinal cord via the bloodstream. Prof Hughes said there was a definite risk of developing GBS following campylobacter infection, as well as others, mostly viral, such as a virus which caused a glandular fever like illness, known as cytomegalovirus. Causes, incidence, and risk factors: The most common causes of meningitis are bacterial infections that start in other parts of the body and spread to the brain or spinal cord via the bloodstream. the next most common cause is a bacterial infection of the bloodstream (bacterial sepsis). Exercise develops muscle, which requires fuel for contraction and relaxation. But Erasistratus himself agrees that human beings digest badly in fevers, adding as the cause that the activity of the stomach has been impaired. Yellow Fever This viral disease is characterised by a severe flu-like illness in which a bleeding tendency and jaundice may develop. Diphtheria is an acute (suddenly developing) bacterial illness which causes a sore throat and fever, and can be life-threatening when the bacteria release a toxin into the bloodstream.	a bacterial population in the bloodstream
Lichens are symbiotic organisms made of green algae and fungi. What do the green algae supply to the fungi in this symbiotic relationship? \n (A) carbon dioxide (B) food (C) protection (D) water\nSlime molds Water molds A lichen is a symbiotic association between a fungus and an alga. The relationship between the fungi and trees is symbiotic because the fungi get carbon from the tree in return for supplying mineral nutrients and water. The algae are tiny green balls, which make the food to feed the fungi. in addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. They are a symbiotic combination of two organisms: a fungus, which anchors the plant and collects water, and an algae, which is a green plant that provides food. A water fern that fixes nitrogen symbiotically with the blue-green alga Anabaena. The fingers are a blue-black symbiotic crust of algae, lichens, fungi and microscopic plants that binds the sandy soil, making it highly resistant to wind and water erosion. Carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis by all green algae, especially symbiotic Zooxanthellae living inside the tissues of your corals and invertebrates. Lichens are organisms made up of algae that provide food, and fungi that provide moisture. The water fern has a symbiotic relationship with a blue-green algae, 'anabaena azollae'.	food
When a switch is used in an electrical circuit, the switch can \n (A) cause the charge to build. (B) increase and decrease the voltage. (C) cause the current to change direction. (D) stop and start the flow of current.\nThe interrupting of the flow of current in an electrical circuit by means of a switch or switching device. Observe the flow of electricity and the stopping of the flow using a switch. Switch : A device that controls the flow of electrical current in a circuit. The rate of flow is the same as the &quot;current&quot; that flows in an electrical circuit when you close the open switch and let the electrons start to flow. Switches A switch is an electrical device  used to enable or disable flow of electrical current in an electrical circuit. They resist current from rapidly getting started flowing when switched into a circuit and then once it is flowing, they don't want to let it stop. The Polarity Switch The polarity switch changes the direction of current in the circuit. Signals from switches When a switch is used to provide an input to a circuit, pressing the switch usually generates a voltage signal. Transfer switches Use a transfer switch when connecting to a building's electrical system. Another is the switch, a device that starts and stops the flow of electrical current by either completing or breaking the circuit's pathway.	stop and start the flow of current.
