_DESCRIPTION = """
With system performance on existing reading comprehension benchmarks nearing or
surpassing human performance, we need a new, hard dataset that improves systems'
capabilities to actually read paragraphs of text. DROP is a crowdsourced,
adversarially-created, 96k-question benchmark, in which a system must resolve
references in a question, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform
discrete operations over them (such as addition, counting, or sorting). These
operations require a much more comprehensive understanding of the content of
paragraphs than what was necessary for prior datasets.
