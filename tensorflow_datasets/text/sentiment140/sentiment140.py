_DESCRIPTION = """
Sentiment140 allows you to discover the sentiment of a brand, product, or topic on Twitter.

The data is a CSV with emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:

0. the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
1. the id of the tweet (2087)
2. the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
3. the query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
4. the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
5. the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
