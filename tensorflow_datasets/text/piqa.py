_DESCRIPTION = """
Physical IQa: Physical Interaction QA, a new commonsense QA benchmark for naive physics
reasoning focusing on how we interact with everyday objects in everyday situations. This
dataset focuses on affordances of objects, i.e., what actions each physical object affords
(e.g., it is possible to use a shoe as a doorstop), and what physical interactions a group
of objects afford (e.g., it is possible to place an apple on top of a book, but not the
other way around). The dataset requires reasoning about both the prototypical use of
objects (e.g., shoes are used for walking) and non-prototypical but practically plausible
use of objects (e.g., shoes can be used as a doorstop). The dataset includes 20,000 QA
pairs that are either multiple-choice or true/false questions.
