The poor man always sat there, looking at the big hotel in which the rich man lived. One day the rich man got out of his car and said to the poor man, \"Excuse me, but I just want to know why you sit here and look at my hotel every morning.\" \"Sir\", said the poor man, \"I am a failure  . I have no money, no family, no home. I sleep on this bench, and every night I dream that one day I'll sleep in that hotel.\" The rich man said, \"Tonight your dream will come true. I'll pay for the best room in that hotel for you for a whole month.\nA few days later, the rich man went by the poor man's room to ask him how he was enjoying himself. To his surprise, he found that the man had moved out of the hotel, back to his park bench. When the rich man asked why, the poor man said, \"you see, when I am down here sleeping on my bench, I dream I'm up there, in that big hotel. It's a wonderful dream. But when I was up there, I dreamed I was back to this cold bench. It was a terrible dream, and I couldn't get any sleep at all.\"", "id": "middle241.txt"}
