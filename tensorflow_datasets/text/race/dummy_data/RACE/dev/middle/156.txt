Everyone who chooses not to take the final exam will get a 'B' for the course.\"\nMost of the students jumped out of their seats. They thanked the teacher happily, and walked out of the classroom. Only a few students stayed. The teacher looked at them. \"This is your last chance,\" he said. \"Does anyone else want to leave?\" All the students there stayed in their seats and took out their pencils.\nThe teacher smiled. \"Congratulations  ,\" he said. \"I'm glad to see you believe in yourselves.
