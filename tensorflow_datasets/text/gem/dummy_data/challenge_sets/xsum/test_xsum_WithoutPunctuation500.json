Murderers have been tried and condemned to death here.\"\nThey include Ronnie Harries, who was one of the last men to be hanged in Wales. He was sentenced to death in 1953 after murdering his relatives Phoebe and John Harries at their home in Llangynin, Carmarthenshire.\nThe Guildhall was also the setting for Gwynfor Evans' landmark victory as first Plaid Cymru MP in 1966.\nMr Jenkins admitted when the Ministry of Justice announced the building was to be sold, they were hoping \"to pick it up for a \u00a31,\" but ended up paying the district valuer's price tag.\nThe council is now speaking to potential partners, including Carmarthen Town Council and Dyfed-Powys Police, about the building's future.\n\"We've got ideas of bringing some of our own services in here,\" said Cllr Jenkins.\n\"It'll also be good as a museum. We could bring people inside just to see how beautiful it is.\n\"The intention is to make the building self sufficient",
