Water is essential for keeping you cool during hot weather.  Water keeps your body cool and should be drunk even if you don't feel thirsty.  It's okay to also drink commercial waters (such as Vitamin Water) or sports drinks such as Powerade or Gatorade but they're usually not necessary unless you're deliberately replenishing lost vitamins/electrolytes following a sporting activity.  The best way to check your hydration level is to measure your urination color.  Anything darker than straw colored is probably an indication that dehydration is on the horizon, and water is needed.  Stay away from sugary drinks such as sodas(even if they are sugar-free!); they decrease the ability of your body to store water.  Also, steer clear of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and caffeinated drinks, which are natural diuretics. Drink plenty of water before engaging in any activities.  If you wait too late, you could experience cramps, which are a sign of heat-related illness.  Remind yourself to drink water frequently with one of the following options.  Purchase a durable water bottle or water pack that you can tote everywhere and refill at any safe water tap. Freeze a bottle of water to carry around with you.  It'll be solid when you leave the house, but the heat will start melting it from the moment you take it out of the freezer.  Wrap it in a towel to prevent water condensation affecting other items in your bag. Download a water drinking app onto your phone.  Set reminders, daily targets, and even track when the last time you had a drink. Food can keep you cool provided you make the right choices. Choose salads, fresh raw food, vegetables and fruit.  “Cool as a cucumber” is literal; it is nearly 100% water, providing hydration to keep you cool.  Avoid eating meat and protein-heavy foods during the heat of the day because these can increase metabolic heat production, which can add to loss of water.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but eating spicy peppers may help cool you off.  They make you sweat, which provides a cooling sensation.  Smaller meals may also help keep your core temperature down.  Large meals require the body to work harder breaking everything down. Find foods that don’t need to be cooked, or don’t need heat to be cooked.  If you must actually cook, keep the cool air in, and the temperature down, by using the microwave instead of the stove or oven. For example, you can microwave frozen vegetables and canned soup instead of cooking them on the stovetop.  Cold soups are great in warm weather. If you haven't tried them yet, hot weather is the excuse you need!  The fact they are often healthy is just an added benefit.  Make popsicles, slushies, frozen fruit, frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats to help you cool down.
Before you can begin to address or cope with your habit of overthinking things, you'll need to learn what kinds of thoughts occur when you're engaging in this damaging behavior. Any time you find yourself indulging in painful, unpleasant, or self-doubting thoughts, you are on the road to overthinking because of cognitive distortions. Likewise if you find yourself listing reasons to not do something, or otherwise making excuses for your self-doubt. The most common cognitive distortions include:  All or nothing thinking - believing things are absolute and seeing every situation as being black or white. Overgeneralization - seeing one negative event as a continuous cycle of defeat or embarrassment. Mental filtering - dwelling only on negative things (thoughts, feelings, outcomes) while ignoring all the positive elements of those situations or scenarios. Discounting the positives - believing that none of your admirable qualities or accomplishments matter. Jumping to conclusions - either assuming that other people are reacting/thinking negatively towards you without any real evidence (called "mind reading") or believing that an event will turn out badly without any evidence for this conclusion. Magnification or minimization - blowing bad things out of proportion or reducing the importance of good things. Emotional reasoning - believing that the way you feel reflects an objective truth about yourself. "Should" statements - chastising yourself or others for things that should or shouldn't have been said/done. Labeling - turning a mistake or shortcoming into a character attribute of yourself. (For example, turning the thought "I messed up" into "I'm a loser and a failure.") Personalization and blame - internalizing fault for situations or events you aren't responsible for, or blaming others for situations/events that they had no control over. There are numerous ways to overthink, many of which are caused by cognitive distortions. One form of overthinking is the thought pattern known as "catastrophizing." Catastrophizing occurs any time you automatically predict a negative outcome to some event or series of events, and jump to the conclusion that such an outcome would be devastating and unbearable. Catastrophizing is a combination of jumping to conclusions and overgeneralizing.  Try to identify which cognitive distortions affect your overthinking the most. Write down the thoughts you experience, and try to label which thoughts could fall into the category of cognitive distortions. Practice learning to recognize your "overthinking" thoughts in the moment, as they arise. Simply naming them when you become aware of them may be helpful. Try silently saying the word "thinking" whenever you begin to overthink - it may help ground you and break you out of your spiraling thought pattern. It's easy to fall into "autopilot" mode during the course of your day. But if your day is filled with situations that have the potential to induce anxiety, you may be walking blindly into a situation that will cause you to overthink and catastrophize.  Try mandating a personal "check in" for yourself. Assess how you're feeling as you enter different scenarios and situations that tend to evoke your pattern of overthinking.  Identify any instance in which you begin to indulge patterns of overthinking. Don't judge yourself for it, just acknowledge it before you work to change it. Once you've identified an incident of overthinking or catastrophizing, you can now begin to challenge the validity of those thoughts. Challenging those thoughts by remembering that thoughts are not facts may help you break out of your pattern of overthinking.  Thoughts do not always reflect reality, and they are oftentimes warped, uninformed, or simply wrong. By letting go of the infallible perception of your thoughts, you'll be more capable of considering other possibilities, or at least accepting that your overthinking isn't always right.  Examine what (if any) real, objective evidence you have to support the cognitive distortions and patterns of overthinking that you're experiencing. There is a good chance that you will not be able to come up with any real, compelling evidence that the thoughts you're experiencing have any basis in truth. Try silently saying to yourself, "These are just thoughts, and they are not truth." Repeating this mantra may help you disengage from the spiraling thought patterns you're stuck in. If your patterns of overthinking are spiraling out of control, it may feel difficult to break out of that thought pattern. However, once you learn to recognize that the thoughts you're experiencing are not factual, you can then fairly easily replace that thought pattern with a more realistic one. Tell yourself, "If I accept that my assumptions and overthinking are not grounded in facts, then what are the facts in this situation?"  Even if a situation ended badly, you can focus on what to do differently next time as an alternative to dwelling on what you should have said/done in the past. It won't come easily at first, but once you retrain your brain to process situations differently, it will eventually get easier. Try asking other people who are aware of the situation for their input. Sometimes asking a trusted friend, relative, or colleague whether you're overreacting or overthinking things can help you realize that there's no reason to continue thinking that way. Try positive self-talk to replace self-doubt or overthinking. The way you talk to yourself (and think about yourself) can affect how you feel. So instead of criticizing yourself or ruminating on bad thoughts, try to focus on the things you did well and continue to do well.
Write down a few of the things that you like to do for fun. Next, write down a few items that you'd use for that hobby. Choose the ones you really like from that list, and add them to your wish list. Here are some ideas to get you started:  If you like to paint or draw, you might need some new graphite pencils, paintbrushes, or paints. If you do oil painting, you might also need some linseed oil or turpentine. Be creative! If you like to show support for your favorite sports team, don't limit yourself to just jerseys, sweatshirts, and hats with your favorite team's logo. A sports game is a great way of showing support. It can also be a great experience. If you like music, why not think about your favorite bands? Are there any new albums that came out or that you don't have? What about posters or shirts?

Sometimes, figuring out what you need is easier than deciding what you want. Think about the past few months. Ask yourself if there was something you really needed at one point but didn't have. Here are some things to get you started:  If you cook a lot, you might find that some of your pots, pans, and other utensils need replacing or updating. You could ask for a new set or blender. If all your cooking gear is in top condition, consider some exotic spices instead. If you have a green thumb, you might like a grow-your-own herb kit. You'll get some pots, soil, and a few popular cooking herbs, such as basil, thyme, and mint. If you play a sport or music, see if your gear needs updating or replacing. Equipment can be expensive, and a birthday is a great chance to get an upgrade. If your birthday is close to winter, it might be a good idea to check and see if your winter clothes still fit. If they don't, you could ask for a new jacket or scarf. Do you have a favorite store that you like to shop in? Visit their website and see if there is anything new that came out since the last time you visited. Sometimes, walking through a store, thumbing through a catalog, or surfing the web may give you some ideas. If you have a free weekend, try visiting your local mall. Be sure to take note of anything that interests you.
