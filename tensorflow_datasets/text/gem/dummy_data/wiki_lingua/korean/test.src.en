When buying a razor, it doesn't matter which brand or what style it is. They are all designed to get the job done. Make sure that you pick one that is gentle on your skin so that your area won't react as badly with it as it would with a harsh razor.  When buying razors, it is ideal to get ones that are to be specifically used on parts of the body. For example, if you buy two razors, one could be used for shaving your pubic area and one could be used for shaving your underarms. Make sure that when you use any razor, you dry it. Leaving a razor wet causes the blades to dull, which will make shaving difficult. If it's loose, you'll end up cutting yourself. Razors perform best on skin that is somewhat flat and doing so will help remove the hair easier. Make sure that you know what parts you are going to shave. Are you allowed to shave? Is it safe for your skin? Make sure that you are completely sure you want to do this before you begin. To start off, is a great idea to shave slowly and with the grain. All this means is that if your hair grows downward, shave downward. This will help prevent irritation. Shaving against the grain is not a good idea when first starting off because doing so causes rashes and itchiness.  Another idea is to shave from side to side. This way, your skin will get more used to the feel of a razor on your private parts.  Do not over-shave. Shave an area only as much as you need to remove the hair. If you go over it too many times, it will become inflamed. In the early stages of shaving, you will probably find that shaving your pubic hair two days in a row causes red bumps and/or itching. Skip several days between shaves until your skin grows used to the change. Yes, hair grows on your bum too. You can shave this too, just make sure to be very gentle because it's not too easy to see where you will be shaving. You can always shave over one last time, just make sure not to press down too hard to prevent inflammation. If you are considering removing all of your hair, know that having none can increase your chances of getting and spreading an STD or two (namely, HPV and molluscum contagiosum). Always make sure that you clean up your mess. Even if you don't care about all those hairs now, they build up later.
