If you start to cut meals out, then you'll just feel tired, sluggish, and hungry, which will make you loose motivation. Choose foods like oatmeal for breakfast which keep you full for a long time, preventing unhealthy snacking before lunch. Eat dinner soon after getting home from work or school so that you don't pig out when you get in.  Remember that breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. If you skip it, you will be much hungrier when you eat lunch and dinner and will eat more.  Don't skip a meal just because you feel guilty for indulging the night before. This will actually get you more off track. If you have a busy schedule, try to plan when you'll have your three meals in advance. This will help you avoid tempting foods that you may come across during the time of a skipped meal. Though you shouldn't have to throw out all of the foods in your fridge and pantry, if you minimize the unhealthy foods in your home, you will be less likely to eat them. You can go through all of the unhealthy foods in your home and decide if you want to throw them out, make a family member eat them, or bring them to work and give them away.  Some of the foods that you think are unhealthy are only unhealthy in excess. For example, if you eat a cup of peanut butter, you won't be helping your weight, but if you resolve to only eat a spoonful of peanut butter with celery at a time, you can keep the food. You can also get rid of the unhealthy foods in your house by making a shopping list that only contains the healthy foods you want to eat on it. When you go shopping, you can be determined to only buy the foods on the list so you don't come home with new unhealthy foods. Replace your unhealthy foods with healthy ones. Get rid of your ice cream and replace it with yogurt or fruit popsicles. You should still always keep some snacking options in your home. The trick is to not think, "Oh, I'm going out tonight, so I'm going to completely break my diet and pick it up again tomorrow." Though you will be faced with more temptations if you're out at a party or going to dinner with your friends, you don't have to completely give up on your diet for a night. Here's how to stay on track while you're out:  Eat before you go out to a party. If you're going out to a party where you know you'll see a lot of delicious snacks, eat a solid meal before so you're less likely to get hungry and grab a snack. Make this meal a healthy, vegetable-based dish, such as a salad. The fiber will make you feel full so that you do not eat as much party food.  Bring snacks with you wherever you go. If you're at a place that has few healthy options, like a movie theatre, bring a bag of almonds, grapes, or trail mix with you to avoid snacking on buttery popcorn. Choose the healthiest options of what you do see at dinner. If you're out for dinner, pick the healthier items on the menu, like grilled chicken, brown rice, or salad, instead of the most greasy or high-fat options. You can still be healthy while eating out. Choose healthy snacks over unhealthy ones. If you're at a party where there are a ton of snacks, snack on the foods in the veggie tray or pita chips instead of the plate of brownies or nachos. Eating at home is the easiest way to make sure to avoid temptation. If you're cooking at home, you can control everything that goes into your menu. When you're eating out, though you can choose healthier options, you won't have as much control over what you eat. Here's how to make the most of eating at home:  Become a master chef. If you develop a love of cooking, you'll be more motivated to cook and will be excited to find new healthy recipes. Invite your friends to eat in instead of going out. Once you develop your cooking skills, if a friend asks you out to dinner, you can offer to stay in and cook instead. Not only will this be cheaper, but you'll be able to eat healthy in a more intimate atmosphere. Try to eat lunch at home or pack your lunch as much as you can. It's easy to splurge on fast food, especially if you're in the middle of a busy work day, but if you pack a simple sandwich or salad with you in the morning, you'll be less likely to want to eat something unhealthy.
