Perhaps the heartiest and the most famous sprouts are the bean sprouts. Legumes sprout thick protuberances that are nutritious and taste great, full of active micronutrients and flavor. Common legumes for sprouting include:  lentils, green or brown especially chickpeas or garbanzo beans mung beans, which are commonly sold in stores as "bean sprouts" green peas Start with about a half cup of dried beans (they tend to plump up some as they absorb water and shake their hulls). The water shouldn't be steaming, but warm to the touch, like a cup of tea you've let sit a bit too long. In your sprouting jar, soak the beans for at least 12 hours. Because the legumes will plump up considerably, make sure there's enough space in the jar and cover the beans by several inches to make sure they'll stay submerged. Rinse the beans twice a day, and store them upside down to drain properly as the sprouts grow. Sometime the first or second day, you might need to shake the jar slightly to remove the hulls. You can add some water and swirl the jar gently to remove them. If some stay on, don't worry to much. You'll be able to pull them off before eating, if necessary. Adzuki beans typically need about 4 days to sprout to their fullest and most delicious potential. Give them some extra time. After the sprouting period is over, you can remove the sprouts from the jar, gently dry them out and remove any extra hulls that haven't separated, or you can leave them on (they're edible, though somewhat bitter). They should be good in the fridge for about a week, if you keep an eye on them and keep them relatively dry. Bean sprouts are particularly good as a topping for broth-based soups, like Vietnamese pho or other spicy dishes. They're also perfect on salads and sandwiches.
