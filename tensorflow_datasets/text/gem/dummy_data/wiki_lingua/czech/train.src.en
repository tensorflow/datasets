Those who are emotionally stable are fantastic at compartmentalizing – in other words, they're mavens at making sure the areas of their lives that are super stressful don't leak into the good parts of their lives, ruining everything that's going well. So if work sucks, make the active decision not to take it home with you. Realize that just because one aspect of your life isn't going how you'd like it to go doesn't mean that your entire life has to be affected. Take a look into yourself and think about what is riling up your emotions and knocking you off your horse. You can't isolate stress until you know where it's coming from. Memories are not as stable as you may think. In fact, they can change each time you recall them. If you’re being bothered by a troublesome memory, make a conscious effort to reframe it in less negative way. Instead of dwelling on the negative emotions that you felt during the experience, pick a more neutral or positive aspect of the memory to focus on. With enough practice, you can build new associations around that memory. For example, if you keep thinking about the day you broke up with your girlfriend, try to focus on some other aspect of that day. E.g., what was the weather like? What were you wearing? What did you eat for breakfast? If you’re used to thinking negatively about yourself, it can be hard to “think positive.” Instead, next time you think something negative, replace that thought with something more realistic. Once you get into the habit of thinking more realistically, it will be easier to start thinking positively. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m a horrible cook. I will never be good at this!” try telling yourself, “If I keep practicing, I will get better at cooking.” This is a more realistic thought, and also easier for a negatively-wired brain to accept than something like, “I am the best cook ever!” “Mindfulness” is the art of being in the moment. When you are mindful, you are focusing on what is happening in the here and now, rather than fixating on the past or worrying about the future. All it takes is being self-aware and having a gentle understanding of yourself.  Take time not only to be aware of what is happening around you at any given moment, but also to be aware of what you are feeling, physically and emotionally. Don’t judge your feelings – just notice them. For example, you might think to yourself, “My knee hurts. I’m feeling a little sad. The breeze feels nice.” A good way to find the quality of mindfulness is meditation. Focus on your breathing patterns, try not to think of anything else, and find your center. It's a break away from life that can help you see the bigger picture. If you’re not sure how to start, try a free mindfulness app, such as Insight Timer. The human mind has the fantastic ability to see, hear, and think what it wants – regardless of the reality of the situation. It's important to keep this in mind whenever you find yourself feeling an emotion you'd rather not be feeling. Take a few moments to assess the situation before jumping to conclusions and acting on your emotions.  For example, if someone says something to you in an unfriendly tone of voice or gives you what seems like a dirty look, don’t jump to the conclusion that they dislike you or are angry at you. Sometimes people are unaware of how they look or sound to others. If you have a question about someone else’s feelings or intentions, the best way to clear the air is to ask. For example, you might ask, “What did you mean by that?” or, “Are you upset with me about something?”
Blow into the recorder to get an idea of how it will sound. You will need to blow gently. Think about blowing bubbles as you do this. Blowing softly with a steady stream of air is one of the most difficult but important techniques as you begin to play recorder.  If you blow too hard, you will produce a sharp, unpleasant sound. Blow more gently in order to produce a musical sound. Breathe from the diaphragm and make sure you blow evenly. It will help to keep the sound consistent. When playing a note on the recorder, you should start and stop the sound with your tongue. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth behind your teeth.  The sound should start and stop there. The first note that people usually learn is B. This requires that you cover the back hole with your left thumb. Now take your left index finger and cover the first hole on the uppermost side under the mouthpiece. Use your right thumb to balance the recorder. Now blow gently into the mouthpiece, remembering to say "ta" or "too". Well done! The sound you just made was a B note.  If the note does not come out, or it squeaks, make sure that your fingers are fully covering the holes, and that your fingers stay flat. Another reason it might squeak is because you're blowing into it too hard. Keep practicing B until you are comfortable with it. A simple fingering chart is used to represent the notes on a recorder. The fingering chart consists of numbers 0 through 7, with 0 representing the left thumb, 1 representing the left index finger, 2 representing the second left finger, and so on.  For example, the B note you just played would be represented on the fingering chart as follows: 0 1 - -  - - - -  The numbers represent the holes that are being covered, while the dashes represent the holes that remain uncovered. In this instance, the 0 indicates that your thumb is covering the hole on the back of the recorder, while the 1 shows that your left index finger is covering the first hole. The first notes that you will learn to play using your left hand are B (which you just played), A and G. The next two notes that you will play with your left hand are C' and D'. The apostrophe at the top right hand corner of these notes indicates that they are high notes.   To play A: Use the same positioning as for a B note, but this time place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for an A note is: 0 12 -  - - - -  To play G: Use the same positioning as for an A note, but this time place your left ring finger on the third hole from the top. The fingering chart for a G note is: 0 123  - - - -  To play C': Cover the back hole with your left thumb, then place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for C' is: 0 - 2 -  - - - -  To play D': Leave the back hole uncovered and place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for D' is: - - 2 -  - - - - The first notes that you will learn to play using your right hand are E, D and F#. The next two notes that you will learn to play with your right hand are F and C. These two notes can be a little tricky for new players as lot of holes need to be covered at once when playing them.   To play E: Cover the back hole with your left thumb, cover the top three holes with your left index, middle and ring fingers, then place your right index finger on the fourth hole from the top and your right middle finger on the fifth hole from the top. The fingering chart for an E note is: 0 123 45 - -  To play D: Use the same positioning as for an E note, but this time place your right ring finger on the sixth hole from the top. The fingering chart for a D note is: 0 123 456 -  To play F#: Use the same positioning as for a D note, but this time remove your right index finger from the fourth hole from the top, leaving all other fingers in place. The fingering chart for an F# is: 0 123  - 56 -  To play F: Place your left thumb on the back hole, the index, middle and ring fingers of your left hand on the top three holes, the index finger of your right hand on the fourth hole, the ring finger of your right hand on the sixth hole, and the baby finger of your right hand on the seventh hole. The fingering chart for an F is: 0 123 4 - 67  To play C: When playing a C, all seven holes are covered. Your left thumb will cover the bottom hole, the index, middle and ring fingers of your left hand will cover the top three holes and the index, middle, ring and baby fingers of your right hand will cover the bottom four. The fingering chart for a C is: 0 123 4567 Once you have mastered all of these notes, you can put them together to play a few simple songs:    Mary Had a Little Lamb:  B A G A B B B A A A B D' D' B A G A B B B A A B A G    Twinkle Twinkle Little Star:  D D A A B B A G G F# F# E E D    Auld Lang Syne: C F F F A G F G A F F A C' D'
