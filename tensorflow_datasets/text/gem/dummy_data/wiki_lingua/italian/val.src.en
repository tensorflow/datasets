You may not be able to find skinless red snapper, but you can remove the skin once you get it home. The fillets will fry more evenly without the skin. Slice the fillets into finger-sized pieces to help them cook more quickly and evenly. Red snapper is so versatile that it tastes great with any type of breading or batter. You can use a classic dry seafood breading, Japanese Panko breading, or a beer batter.  To make a dry breading, mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add black and red pepper to taste. Panko is a popular choice as well. This breading is sold in canisters available in the breading aisle in the grocery store. If you like the taste of beer batter, mix 2 cups flour and one 12-ounce beer. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Pour enough oil into a stockpot to rise up the sides by two inches. Heat it over medium high heat until it reaches 365 degrees. Check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer before you proceed, since the fish won't fry correctly if the oil isn't hot enough. Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as canola oil or peanut oil. Olive oil and other low smoke point oils will break down when they're heated to a high temperature. Be sure each piece is well coated on all sides. Try placing the fillets and batter together in a bag and shaking it to coat the fillets evenly. Place them in the oil a few at a time. Fry them for one or two minutes, or until the pieces float. Don’t crowd the pan or they won’t cook properly. The fish will fry very quickly, so monitor the pieces carefully to ensure they don't burn. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the pot to a towel-lined plate. The fried fish pieces are excellent when served with lemon wedges and tartar sauce.
