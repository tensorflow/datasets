Experiencing the loss of someone close, or past experiences with neglect and physical, mental, or sexual abuse can be a very traumatic. A person who has experienced any of this is more likely to encounter behavioral and psychological challenges because there is that underlying fear that these events could occur again in their current relationships.  Some common emotional and behavioral reactions of fear of abandonment include: mood swings and fits of anger, as well as other behaviors that may alienate you from those you hold close. Other symptoms may include poor self-esteem, low self-worth, severe anxiety or panic attacks, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and difficulty adapting to change. Fear of abandonment can also impair the ability to trust others and experience. It may lead to co-dependence and associating with people who reinforce those negative thoughts. Much of the time, fear of abandonment has its roots in a childhood trauma. If you lost a parent or caretaker to death, divorce, or another cause, you might unconsciously fear the same scenario playing out again with other people. Sometimes, trauma experienced in adulthood can also make you afraid of being abandoned. Ask yourself whether you have lost a partner or someone else close to you through death, divorce, or financial abandonment. These situations can create a general fear of abandonment in some people. Many people who are afraid of others leaving them suffer from low self-esteem. If you frequently seek validation from other people or attempt to derive your self-worth from your relationships, you might be afraid that others will abandon you and cut off the source of your positive feelings about yourself. People who are predisposed to anxiety are more likely to fear being abandoned. Many anxious people have vivid imaginations. If you have imagined what it would be like to be abandoned, you might become afraid of it happening, even if it has never actually happened to you before.  People with anxiety tend to expect the worst in a situation. For example, you might get anxious (e.g. your heartbeats fast and your palm sweats) when your partner does not immediately answer a phone call. You might worry that there has been an accident, or that the person is purposely avoiding you. In order to overcome anxiety, you must learn to challenge how realistic your thoughts are. Do you have reason to suspect your partner has been in an accident? Is there evidence to show he or she is ignoring you? To combat anxiety most effectively, it may be helpful to see a mental health therapist who has experience treating this condition. Depending on the severity of your fear and how this is currently impacting your life, it may be beneficial to seek guidance and support from a qualified therapist or counselor. Look for someone who is certified in treating people with fear of abandonment, as they may be able to help you learn to separate fears of the past from what is actually happening in the present. As you learn to separate the past from the present, and recognize that your fears are not realistic expectations in your current life, you can begin to develop healthier coping skills to any emotional responses you may have in your daily life.
