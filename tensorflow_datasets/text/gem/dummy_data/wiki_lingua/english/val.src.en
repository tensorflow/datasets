Each step consists of 2 main parts: a riser, which is the vertical part of the step, and the tread, which is the part you step on. Other important terms to know when building your stairs include:  The pitch line, an imaginary line that runs from the lip of the bottom stair to the lip of the topmost step. The “pitch” of the stairs is the angle between the base of the stairs and the pitch line. The rise, which is the total height of your staircase from its base to the topmost step. The run of your stairs, which is the depth of your stair measured from the front of your staircase to its back. The stringers of your stairs are the side supports to either side of each step. The measurements for your stringers will be used in the creation of your concrete forms. First, you'll need to find the total rise of your stairs, which can be found by measuring the total height from the planned base to the higher level/floor you are building up to. Then:  Measure the run of the steps by finding the distance between the frontmost and backmost part of the stair. Find the width of your stairs by measuring the distance between the leftmost and rightmost bounds of your planned steps. You can do this by finding the rise (total height from the bottom level to the top level) of your stairs and dividing that number by the riser height (the height of each step). Standard risers are between 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm). The building code in some states sets the maximum riser height at 8.25" (21 cm), but you should be sure to check your local building code to prevent building stairs that violate state code or local ordinances.  If this number comes out as a decimal, you must round up to the next whole number. If your stairs are built so the topmost tread is a step below the level/floor you are building up to, the number of treads you need will be 1 less than the number of risers. Otherwise, you will need an equal number of treads and risers. There are many online sites that offer simple step calculators to simplify this process. You should be able to find these through a general Internet search for a "stair calculator." These calculators will help you determine the exact specifications of your steps, including the number of treads, height of each riser, stringer length, pitch line, and so on. Divide the total rise (height) of the entire staircase by the number of risers. Generally, you should round the riser height of your steps to the nearest 1/16 inch (1.6 mm). You may have to install brackets in the concrete when you pour, so determine if handrails are a necessity for your stairs. If the stairs are next to a wall, you can always attach a handrail to that.
