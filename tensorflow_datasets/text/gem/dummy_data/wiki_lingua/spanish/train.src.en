Honesty is usually the best policy. It is disrespectful to lie to someone. If you don't want to date someone, you should say so.  Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, "No, thank you, I already have a date for that party." Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, "No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit." Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you "sandwich" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, "You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!" You could also try, "You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, "That sounds fun, but no thank you. I'm not interested in dating you." Don't beat around the bush. If you do not want to accept the date, there is no need to say, "Let me think about it." It is best to get the rejection over with. You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, "I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept." Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly. It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date.
Go online and simply search “Decor Style Quizzes” in order to get some direction. These quizzes will determine your personal style by having you choose between different rooms, accessories, and pieces of furniture. As you take the quiz, reflect on whether or not you could see yourself relaxing and/or entertaining guests in each space. Some styles that these quizzes may determine you have include:  Happy modern Warm industrial Eclectic collector Classic glam Keep in mind that a single style may not fit your tastes. Feel free to mix and match elements to create a unique, but cohesive, style. Buy some interior decorating magazines and cut out any rooms, furniture pieces, and accessories in the magazines that you like and then make a collage or scrapbook out of the clippings. Search your specific decor style on sites like Pinterest and save any pins that you like to your “Decor Style” board. This should help you develop a clearer sense of style. Include your specific style in your Pinterest search. For example, search “modern style large living room” or “traditional style large living room.” You likely already own several furniture pieces and accessories that fit your style, so go through your home and make note of what you enjoy having and what you’d like to replace. Get rid of the pieces that don’t fit your vision and purchase new pieces that stay true to your style.  If you can’t afford to get several new pieces at once, keep your current furniture and accessories and replace one at a time over the course of several months. To save money, consider changing the pieces you can without replacing them. For instance, you could paint an old boring dresser that you have a bright color or change the upholstery on your dining room chairs to better fit your style. You can also repurpose items to fit your needs. For instance, instead of buying a new coffee table, make one out of crates or a large trunk. As you’re trying to determine your style, consider who you are and what kind of life you live. For instance, if you’re always planning your next trip and are passionate about seeing the world, you may want to go for a boho world-traveler theme that incorporates bright worldly colors, antique furniture, and organic textures, such as wooden stools and leather poufs. Some other styles you may consider include:  Top-notch tastemaker: classic designer pieces, neutral backdrop, and high-tech gadgets.

The size of a shuffleboard table can range anywhere from nine feet to twenty-two feet. Keep in mind the amount of space you have to build and store it. You wouldn’t want to build a fourteen foot long table in a twelve foot shed. Remember you need at least two feet of additional space on each end of the table to actually play. The size you decide on will affect what dimensions and plans you use for the playing surface, the bed and the legs. You can find dimensions for shuffleboard tables online. They can save time and help you avoid mistakes. Looks for plans that are detailed and that tell you exactly how long the table should be, the width of the box, and the height of the legs. Map out the dimensions of each board you use, if you make plans yourself. Find pre-made plans at http://www.zieglerworld.com/shuffleboard-plans.htm. While maple or oak will give you the most durable table, these materials may be too expensive. For something more moderately priced, consider using plywood and bamboo flooring for the surface, which can be just as good once it's sealed and polished. Use mahogany for the trim, if you want a classic touch.
