You may be able to get regular rice to taste similar to sushi rice with the help of the right seasoning. However, it is very difficult to get regular rice to have the same sticky consistency as sushi rice. You may be able to use the rice from this method in sashimi, bento, and sushi rolls, but you may find it too difficult to mold for nigiri. The water will likely stop boiling for a few seconds when you add the rice. Wait for the water and rice start to boil again, then reduce the heat and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Continue cooking the rice until all of the water is absorbed. Set it aside and let it cool. During the next few steps, you want to avoid using anything made out of metal, or you will risk the vinegar picking up a metallic taste. Japanese sticky rice is best while it is still warm, but not hot.
