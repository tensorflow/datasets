Honesty is usually the best policy. It is disrespectful to lie to someone. If you don't want to date someone, you should say so.  Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, "No, thank you, I already have a date for that party." Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, "No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit." Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you "sandwich" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, "You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!" You could also try, "You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, "That sounds fun, but no thank you. I'm not interested in dating you." Don't beat around the bush. If you do not want to accept the date, there is no need to say, "Let me think about it." It is best to get the rejection over with. You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, "I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept." Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly. It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date.
If you were able to catch the dog, you will now need to decide what you are going to do with him. As heartwarming as it may sound to adopt him, you should first explore your different options. One option is to surrender him by taking him to an animal shelter.  If you surrender him to an animal shelter, the shelter will place a 'stray hold' on the dog before making him available for adoption. This holding period, usually between three and 10 days, is a legal obligation that ensures the dog will not be adopted out if his original owner claims him within that timeframe. Surrendering the dog at the animal shelter may make it easier for his owner to find him. Be mindful that your veterinarian's office may not be able to house the dog. In fact, some veterinary offices serve as pick-up locations for animal shelters. If you choose not to surrender the dog, then you will need to foster him temporarily and attempt to find the dog's owner. In most places, you are legally obligated to do your due diligence to locate the dog's owner before rehoming the dog. The amount of time required to search for the owner may vary by location. Check with your local animal control about the requirements for your city and state.  Your efforts to find the dog's owner must be documented. Contact your local animal control center or animal shelter if you decide to find the dog's owner on your own. This lets them know you have the dog in case the owner contacts them.  If the dog has an identification tag or microchip, contact the owner directly. If you cannot contact the owner directly, post flyers in different locations (e.g., veterinary offices, supermarkets, newspaper). The flyers should have a picture of the dog, information about where and when you found him, and your contact information. Do not include every detail about the dog on the flyers. That way, when people start to contact you, you can ask more specific questions to identify the actual owner. Consider posting the dog's information on animal rescue websites, such as Petfinder. If the period of due diligence has passed and you are unable to locate the dog's owner, begin to find the dog a new home, whether it's your home or someone else's. If you want to adopt him, you will need to prove that you are his new owner by obtaining a new license, collar, identification tag, and providing proof of vaccination.  If you have other pets, consider if they would get along with the new dog. The time you spent fostering the dog would have let you observe the interactions between the dog, your current pets, and other household members. If adopting the dog will not work for you, work on finding another owner for the dog. Take him to your veterinarian for some initial care (e.g., vaccinations, deworming), then start putting the word out in the community through friends, neighbors, and social media.  Contact local animal shelters and rescue groups for help with finding a new home for the dog.
If you want to go directly to a specific page on a website, you will need to enter the file path. The file path always follows a "/". The "/" in a URL represents a subdirectory within the website. Each "/" marks that you are descending one level deeper into the site. The file path is followed by the file name, and sometimes the file extension "example.com/subdirectory/filename.html". Most URLs do not require the file extension – it fills automatically. However, it is often necessary to include. Make sure you are entering the correct file path, as /page.php and /page.html are completely separate files You may be more likely to make a mistake when copying long chains of characters into the address box by hand. If you have access to the text of the web address, simply copy and paste it into the address bar. Strange characters may appear in the address bar: ?, #, and series of numbers. You don't need to worry about these, except insofar as you must copy out the chains of digits to reach certain specific sites.  A "?" with numbers/letters following the url is called a parameter. Parameters are automatically generated and not necessary to type in. A "#" followed by letters/numbers is called an anchor. Websites sometimes have certain points specified on a page, that let you jump directly to a specific place on the page. The page will automatically scroll to the place the anchor is found.
