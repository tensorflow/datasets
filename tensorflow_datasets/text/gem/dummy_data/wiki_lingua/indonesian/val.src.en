Many online jewelers offer tables that help you convert inches and centimeters into ring sizes. Print the table out, or simply bookmark the page so you can refer to it when you need to. You can also walk into a jeweler’s store near you to ask if they offer these tables.  These tables will have rows and columns that list measurements next to ring sizes so you can easily convert the diameter of your finger to a standard ring size.  Here is an example of a table you can find online: https://www.justmensrings.com/mens-ring-size-chart Use paper that is sturdy enough not to rip but also easy to wrap around something. The paper you use in your printer should work well. When cutting the paper with scissors, just estimate how long it needs to be to wrap around your finger. It doesn’t need to be an exact length or width. You must wrap it around the finger you plan to wear your ring on, otherwise the size will be inaccurate. Don’t wrap it around where your ring will actually sit, since your ring will need to be wide enough to fit over your knuckle. When you’re done tightening the piece of paper, make sure you can move it easily past your knuckle in both directions. Make your mark on the top part of the paper. Your line should show exactly where the edge of the bottom half of the paper is hitting the top half. If you’re having trouble making this mark while holding the paper in place, ask a friend or family member for help. For greater accuracy, measure the piece of paper in centimeters rather than inches. This is the measurement you’ll need to figure out your size. Find your measurement on the left-hand side of the table you're using. Then look down the row to the column that tells you your ring size. Some tables will give the sizes for different international markets, so make sure you’re looking at the size that applies to you. Start the process again with a new piece of paper. If you get the same measurement, you can be confident that you found your ring size. If you get a different measurement, try a third time. If your third reading matches one of your first 2, go with that size. If your third gives you yet another measurement, consult a jeweler for a more accurate sizing.
