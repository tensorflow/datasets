Find a ring size conversion table on the Internet. Cut out a strip of paper that is long enough to fit around your finger. Wrap the piece of paper around the knuckle of your finger until it fits snugly. Draw a line to mark where the two pieces of paper are meeting. Use a ruler to measure the piece of paper up to the pencil mark. Consult the size conversion table to determine your ring size. Measure again to make sure you got an accurate size.
