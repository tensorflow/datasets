If you've installed a third-party program like WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip, you won't be able to unzip files according to the steps in this method. You can ensure that your computer uses the default software instead by doing the following:  Open Start {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/0\/07\/Windowsstart.png","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/0\/07\/Windowsstart.png\/30px-Windowsstart.png","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":460,"bigWidth":"30","bigHeight":"30","licensing":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>I edited this screenshot of a Windows icon.\n<\/p><p>License: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Public_domain\">Public Domain<\/a><br>\n<\/p><\/div>"}. Type in choose a default app, then click Choose a default app for each file type in the Start menu. Scroll down to the .zip heading, then click the program to the right of it. If you can't find the .zip option, your computer is set up to use the default software to open ZIP folders. Click Windows Explorer in the pop-up menu. Go to the folder in which the ZIP folder is stored. Skip this step if the ZIP folder is on the Desktop. Doing so opens the ZIP folder in File Explorer. It's a tab at the top of the window. Doing so opens the Extract toolbar near the top of the window. This is in the Extract toolbar. A new window will open. If you want to place the unzipped folder in a location other than the current folder in which the ZIP folder is stored, do the following:  Click Browse... on the right side of the window. Click the name of the folder in which you want to store the unzipped folder. Click Select Folder. It's at the bottom of the window. Your ZIP folder's contents will begin extracting to an unzipped folder in your selected location. If the "Show extracted files when complete" box isn't checked, check it before you click Extract to ensure that the extracted folder will open upon completion. Once the extraction completes, the unzipped folder will open to reveal the ZIP folder's extracted contents. If the extraction completes and the unzipped folder doesn't open, go to the location in which the unzipped folder is stored and double-click the unzipped folder to open it.
Water is essential for keeping you cool during hot weather.  Water keeps your body cool and should be drunk even if you don't feel thirsty.  It's okay to also drink commercial waters (such as Vitamin Water) or sports drinks such as Powerade or Gatorade but they're usually not necessary unless you're deliberately replenishing lost vitamins/electrolytes following a sporting activity.  The best way to check your hydration level is to measure your urination color.  Anything darker than straw colored is probably an indication that dehydration is on the horizon, and water is needed.  Stay away from sugary drinks such as sodas(even if they are sugar-free!); they decrease the ability of your body to store water.  Also, steer clear of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and caffeinated drinks, which are natural diuretics. Drink plenty of water before engaging in any activities.  If you wait too late, you could experience cramps, which are a sign of heat-related illness.  Remind yourself to drink water frequently with one of the following options.  Purchase a durable water bottle or water pack that you can tote everywhere and refill at any safe water tap. Freeze a bottle of water to carry around with you.  It'll be solid when you leave the house, but the heat will start melting it from the moment you take it out of the freezer.  Wrap it in a towel to prevent water condensation affecting other items in your bag. Download a water drinking app onto your phone.  Set reminders, daily targets, and even track when the last time you had a drink. Food can keep you cool provided you make the right choices. Choose salads, fresh raw food, vegetables and fruit.  “Cool as a cucumber” is literal; it is nearly 100% water, providing hydration to keep you cool.  Avoid eating meat and protein-heavy foods during the heat of the day because these can increase metabolic heat production, which can add to loss of water.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but eating spicy peppers may help cool you off.  They make you sweat, which provides a cooling sensation.  Smaller meals may also help keep your core temperature down.  Large meals require the body to work harder breaking everything down. Find foods that don’t need to be cooked, or don’t need heat to be cooked.  If you must actually cook, keep the cool air in, and the temperature down, by using the microwave instead of the stove or oven. For example, you can microwave frozen vegetables and canned soup instead of cooking them on the stovetop.  Cold soups are great in warm weather. If you haven't tried them yet, hot weather is the excuse you need!  The fact they are often healthy is just an added benefit.  Make popsicles, slushies, frozen fruit, frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats to help you cool down.
Iron needs vary during different stages of life and for men and women. Young children, adolescents experiencing growth spurts, menstruating women, and pregnant women often have elevated iron needs. Many infants are given iron supplements or fed iron-fortified formula to achieve adequate iron levels. Anemic individuals or people taking antacids also may require iron supplements to ensure adequate intake. Your doctor can help you decide whether you need additional iron supplements.  In most cases, adequate iron intake can be achieved through the diet or through a standard multi-vitamin. Pregnant women taking prenatal vitamins may already be receiving iron supplementation. In many cases, a simple blood test can give immediate feedback on your current iron levels and alert you to a potential deficiency.  To confirm an actual deficiency or anemia, additional blood tests must be conducted. These can help determine whether the deficiency is caused by inadequate intake or another medical condition. The people most at risk of iron deficiency are pregnant women, infants and young children, women with heavy menstrual bleeding, frequent blood donors, and people with cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, or heart failure. People who live in developing countries are also at higher risk. Many iron supplements are available for purchase without a prescription.  Depending on your needs, a single low-dose supplement each day may help you achieve adequate intake. Remember that supplements are only necessary to make up the difference between your dietary intake and your iron needs. Infant iron supplement drops and other specialty supplements often require a prescription from a physician or nurse practitioner.
