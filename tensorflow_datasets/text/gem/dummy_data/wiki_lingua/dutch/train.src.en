Honesty is usually the best policy. It is disrespectful to lie to someone. If you don't want to date someone, you should say so.  Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, "No, thank you, I already have a date for that party." Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, "No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit." Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you "sandwich" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, "You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!" You could also try, "You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, "That sounds fun, but no thank you. I'm not interested in dating you." Don't beat around the bush. If you do not want to accept the date, there is no need to say, "Let me think about it." It is best to get the rejection over with. You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, "I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept." Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly. It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date.
Guinea pigs are social creatures, so if you have more than one, you should avoid separating them when one is dying. Doing so could make both animals anxious or sad, and this is the last thing you want to do as your guinea pig makes his grand exit. It might be a good idea to separate your ailing guinea pig from his friends if he is in pain or the other guinea pig tries to rough-house with him. You will need to make this judgment yourself based on the situation. Placing a small, light-weight blanket or piece of soft cloth on top of or around your guinea pig will keep him from getting cold and will help him relax. Your guinea pig may become incontinent as his bodily systems begin to shut down, so change out the blanket every so often to keep your pet reasonably clean and comfortable.  Many animals (and people) are much more sensitive to cold as they age and begin to die, so keeping your older guinea pig's cage environment slightly warmer than you used to can improve his comfort substantially. Use a material or cloth that your guinea pig is familiar with to enhance his comfort with the situation. A dying guinea pig will become very weak and unable to feed or water himself as his death approaches. You can make his passing less uncomfortable by offering him water from a spoon, syringe, or water bottle. Blend or mix a guinea pig "smoothie" that contains hay, water and ground up pellets and feed it to him.  Don't force your guinea pig to eat or drink if he doesn't want to. You simply want to make these things accessible to him if he can't get them himself. Make sure anything you feed your guinea pig is well-blended so he doesn't have to use up precious energy chewing (which he might not be able to do, anyway). You can gently cuddle or stroke your guinea pig to comfort him and express affection. This will help your guinea pig know that he is not alone and should reduce any fear or anxiety he may be experiencing. If you hold him, do so in a way you know he likes and that won't cause him any unnecessary pain or discomfort.  Many guinea pigs like to have their foreheads gently stroked. If you know your pet enjoys this, do this as he passes away. Take note of any body language or noises your guinea pig may be making and adjust your physical contact with him accordingly; don't do anything that causes your pet pain. Your guinea pig will be most comfortable in warm, quiet space with lighting that is neither too bright nor too dark. Soft, pleasant, natural sounds (such as birds singing or the babbling of a brook) may be comforting to your pet. It may also be best to give him some space toward the end so he can slip away peacefully. Check on him often to offer food and water.  If there is a specific toy or other item you know your guinea pig is fond of, place this object next to him. The simple presence of items he enjoys may provide your pet a sense of calm. Treat your dying guinea pig as you would a sleeping baby; anything that is likely to wake a snoozing infant will probably also be unpleasant for your pet.
If you want to go directly to a specific page on a website, you will need to enter the file path. The file path always follows a "/". The "/" in a URL represents a subdirectory within the website. Each "/" marks that you are descending one level deeper into the site. The file path is followed by the file name, and sometimes the file extension "example.com/subdirectory/filename.html". Most URLs do not require the file extension – it fills automatically. However, it is often necessary to include. Make sure you are entering the correct file path, as /page.php and /page.html are completely separate files You may be more likely to make a mistake when copying long chains of characters into the address box by hand. If you have access to the text of the web address, simply copy and paste it into the address bar. Strange characters may appear in the address bar: ?, #, and series of numbers. You don't need to worry about these, except insofar as you must copy out the chains of digits to reach certain specific sites.  A "?" with numbers/letters following the url is called a parameter. Parameters are automatically generated and not necessary to type in. A "#" followed by letters/numbers is called an anchor. Websites sometimes have certain points specified on a page, that let you jump directly to a specific place on the page. The page will automatically scroll to the place the anchor is found.
