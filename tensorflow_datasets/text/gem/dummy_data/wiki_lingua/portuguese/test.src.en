As you continue playing, surviving becomes painful, and eating Cooked Morsel, Frog Legs, and Berries won't be enough. Food you gathered are also easily spoiled and with hardly enough good effect on health. You need a Crock Pot to have better food for health regeneration.  A Crock Pot is a contraption that lets you combine and cook four food items into a recipe. Craft it with 3 Cut Stones, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs using the Alchemy Engine. Get Cut Stones from 3 Rocks using the Science Machine. Charcoal can be gathered from burnt trees. If there are no burnt trees around, look for a small patch of trees (preferably far from the thick forest), and torch them down. Twigs can be used as filler for some foods in the Crock Pot. There are lots of food you can whip up with your Crock Pot, and it's not really necessary to use 4 food items for a meal. For example, you only need Frog Legs and a Mushroom and 2 Twigs for a Froggle Bunwich. An Alchemy Engine is a craftable science structure that unlocks more crafting recipes to aid in your survival. With much more powerful weapons and tougher armor, you can withstand any Hound attack and increase your chances of survival, especially during harsh winters.  To create an Alchemy Engine, you need 6 Gold, 4 Boards, and 2 Cut Stones. With the Alchemy Engine, create an Ice Box where you can store your food, thereby reducing the spoilage rate by 50%. An Ice Box requires 2 Gold, 1 Board, and 1 Gear. You can gather Gear from clockwork monsters. Having a Farm is possible in the game. Weapons, armor, and other items can be crafted easily with the proper materials gathered around the world. A Farm, however, requires patience, and you need seeds to plant.  To have a really good and fast harvest, you need an Improved Farm, which can be crafted with 10 Cut Grass, 6 Manure, and 4 Rocks using the Alchemy Machine. Manure can be found and gathered by exploring a Beefalo Field when you chance upon one. Beefalo herds can be found in Savanna biomes and won't attack you unless provoked. You can also use Manure as fertilizer for your plants. Farming seeds give you random results, with plants producing either vegetables or fruits. Now that you have the essentials, you can survive the game for days. Just make sure you've built walls around your base, and you have enough food in your Ice Box. Explore the area to unravel its mysteries, and gather what you need for your next weapon and armor. Keep in mind that going up a level will have you starting all over again.
