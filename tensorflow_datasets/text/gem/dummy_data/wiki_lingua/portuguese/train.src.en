Girls typically have higher-pitched voices than boys, but this isn't always the case. For example, Scarlett Johansson is known for her deep voice. Play around with your voice to see how you want to sound while you're wearing your disguise.  It's helpful to practice your voice with someone you trust who can give you an opinion about how you sound.

Additionally, take shorter strides and try to keep your knees close together and your elbows pressed in toward your body. Girls typically shrink to take up less space, so keep that in mind as you move around.  Walk slowly when you're getting used to walking more like a girl. If you're wearing heels, be careful that you don't fall or stomp around. Give yourself time to get used to them. Squat slightly to make your spread-leg stance appear more natural. Additionally, hunch your shoulders forward slightly. To avoid using your hands too much, put them in your pockets or carry something you can play with, such as your phone.  Boys don't use their hands as much when they talk. Additionally, they usually keep their hands occupied. It can also help to keep your movements more stiff. Society often teaches girls to be more modest, so it's common for them to sit with their legs together or with one leg crossed over the other. Adopting either of these poses while you're sitting will help you appear more like a girl. This is especially important if you decided to wear a dress. If you don't keep your legs together, people are going to see up your skirt. Males often feel more comfortable when they spread their legs and arms when sitting. This is because of the way their body is constructed. Some people call this tendency to spread out “manspreading.” If you want people to think you're a boy, sitting with your knees apart and your arms stretched out around you can help. Don't worry about taking up too much space when you're “manspreading.” Remember, there's no one way to be a boy or a girl, so what you want to talk about will depend on your own preferences. Think about the type of boy or girl you would like to be, then pick topics that seem like they fit with your desired self-image. For example, both boys and girls can like sports.
While the water is coming to a boil, line a glass or ceramic baking dish with aluminum foil. Make sure the shiny side of the aluminum foil is facing up. Then slowly add ½ cup (4.06 oz) of white vinegar. You want to add the vinegar slowly because it will cause the baking soda to fizz. Once all the vinegar is in, mix the ingredients together until well-combined. Make sure the salt is completely dissolved. If not, the granules may scratch your silver. Then carefully place each piece of silver into the baking dish. Make sure they are lying flat and are not overlapping. Let the silver sit in the baking dish for 5 to 10 minutes. Use salad tongs to rotate and flip the pieces of silver to make sure each side is exposed to the aluminum foil. Place each piece on a clean cloth to cool. Then rinse each piece one by one with warm water. Use a soft, cotton cloth to dry the pieces of silver. Make sure to thoroughly dry pieces of silver that contain small crevices and etchings. Do not polish your silver with other types of fabric since these may scratch your silver. Remember that you can use nitrile gloves to avoid smudging while drying and polishing your pieces of silver.
Honesty is usually the best policy. It is disrespectful to lie to someone. If you don't want to date someone, you should say so.  Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, "No, thank you, I already have a date for that party." Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, "No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit." Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you "sandwich" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, "You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!" You could also try, "You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, "That sounds fun, but no thank you. I'm not interested in dating you." Don't beat around the bush. If you do not want to accept the date, there is no need to say, "Let me think about it." It is best to get the rejection over with. You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, "I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept." Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly. It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date.
