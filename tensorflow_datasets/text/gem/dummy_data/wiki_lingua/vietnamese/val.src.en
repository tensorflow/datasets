If your pain is worsened when you move your neck or upper back, cervical spondylosis may be to blame. This is one of the most common causes of left arm pain. More than 90% of people older than 65 have evidence of cervical spondylosis. This is a general term for age-related tears affecting the disks in your spine (particularly in your neck area). As the disks dehydrate and shrink, cervical spondylosis develops. It tends to worsen with age as the back wears out.   Moving your neck and upper spine can determine the cause of the pain. When movement increases your pain, this is probably related to cervical spondylosis. Heart attack pain is not lessened or worsened by movement or applying pressure on the spine or neck. If movement or pressure aggravates the pain and you are without other symptoms, it is most likely cervical spondylosis. However, this is still a serious condition that you should report to your doctor. If the pain flares up in your arm when you move your shoulder, it could actually be shoulder arthritis. Many patients that come into the emergency department with the fear that they're having a heart attack are actually suffering from this condition. This is a disease that destroys the smooth outer covering (cartilage) of the bone. As the cartilage disappears, the protective space decreases between the bones. During movement, the bones rub against each other, causing shoulder pain and/or pain in the left arm. Although no definitive cure exists for arthritis of the shoulder, many treatment options are available to relieve the pain. If this describes you, don't worry. It sounds serious, but the progression can be stopped. If you lose the function in your arm, it's most likely to be a nerve-related injury. The arm nerves arise at the spinal cord level in the lower neck and form a nerve bundle, called the brachial plexus. This bundle splits, giving rise to the nerves of the arm. Arm nerve damage from the shoulder to the hand causes varying pain, but usually this is associated with a loss in arm function (such as numbness, tingling, or decreased range of motion). Your arm pain could be on the nerve level and have zero to do with your heart. If these are affected, peripheral arterial disease may be the cause. This is due to atherosclerosis and is more common amongst smokers. To determine if this is the culprit, a quick visit to your doctor and getting your blood pressure and heart rate checked will solve the puzzle. Think back to see if you can remember any recent injuries you may have sustained. Your left arm pain could be related to an arm or shoulder injury from recent trauma. Speak to your doctor if your arm pain is ongoing and if you cannot find any logical reason for it. If left arm pain presents suddenly, with sweats, disorientation and other pain, see a doctor immediately and allow her to rule out life-threatening conditions.
