Water is essential for keeping you cool during hot weather.  Water keeps your body cool and should be drunk even if you don't feel thirsty.  It's okay to also drink commercial waters (such as Vitamin Water) or sports drinks such as Powerade or Gatorade but they're usually not necessary unless you're deliberately replenishing lost vitamins/electrolytes following a sporting activity.  The best way to check your hydration level is to measure your urination color.  Anything darker than straw colored is probably an indication that dehydration is on the horizon, and water is needed.  Stay away from sugary drinks such as sodas(even if they are sugar-free!); they decrease the ability of your body to store water.  Also, steer clear of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and caffeinated drinks, which are natural diuretics. Drink plenty of water before engaging in any activities.  If you wait too late, you could experience cramps, which are a sign of heat-related illness.  Remind yourself to drink water frequently with one of the following options.  Purchase a durable water bottle or water pack that you can tote everywhere and refill at any safe water tap. Freeze a bottle of water to carry around with you.  It'll be solid when you leave the house, but the heat will start melting it from the moment you take it out of the freezer.  Wrap it in a towel to prevent water condensation affecting other items in your bag. Download a water drinking app onto your phone.  Set reminders, daily targets, and even track when the last time you had a drink. Food can keep you cool provided you make the right choices. Choose salads, fresh raw food, vegetables and fruit.  “Cool as a cucumber” is literal; it is nearly 100% water, providing hydration to keep you cool.  Avoid eating meat and protein-heavy foods during the heat of the day because these can increase metabolic heat production, which can add to loss of water.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but eating spicy peppers may help cool you off.  They make you sweat, which provides a cooling sensation.  Smaller meals may also help keep your core temperature down.  Large meals require the body to work harder breaking everything down. Find foods that don’t need to be cooked, or don’t need heat to be cooked.  If you must actually cook, keep the cool air in, and the temperature down, by using the microwave instead of the stove or oven. For example, you can microwave frozen vegetables and canned soup instead of cooking them on the stovetop.  Cold soups are great in warm weather. If you haven't tried them yet, hot weather is the excuse you need!  The fact they are often healthy is just an added benefit.  Make popsicles, slushies, frozen fruit, frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats to help you cool down.
Those who are emotionally stable are fantastic at compartmentalizing – in other words, they're mavens at making sure the areas of their lives that are super stressful don't leak into the good parts of their lives, ruining everything that's going well. So if work sucks, make the active decision not to take it home with you. Realize that just because one aspect of your life isn't going how you'd like it to go doesn't mean that your entire life has to be affected. Take a look into yourself and think about what is riling up your emotions and knocking you off your horse. You can't isolate stress until you know where it's coming from. Memories are not as stable as you may think. In fact, they can change each time you recall them. If you’re being bothered by a troublesome memory, make a conscious effort to reframe it in less negative way. Instead of dwelling on the negative emotions that you felt during the experience, pick a more neutral or positive aspect of the memory to focus on. With enough practice, you can build new associations around that memory. For example, if you keep thinking about the day you broke up with your girlfriend, try to focus on some other aspect of that day. E.g., what was the weather like? What were you wearing? What did you eat for breakfast? If you’re used to thinking negatively about yourself, it can be hard to “think positive.” Instead, next time you think something negative, replace that thought with something more realistic. Once you get into the habit of thinking more realistically, it will be easier to start thinking positively. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m a horrible cook. I will never be good at this!” try telling yourself, “If I keep practicing, I will get better at cooking.” This is a more realistic thought, and also easier for a negatively-wired brain to accept than something like, “I am the best cook ever!” “Mindfulness” is the art of being in the moment. When you are mindful, you are focusing on what is happening in the here and now, rather than fixating on the past or worrying about the future. All it takes is being self-aware and having a gentle understanding of yourself.  Take time not only to be aware of what is happening around you at any given moment, but also to be aware of what you are feeling, physically and emotionally. Don’t judge your feelings – just notice them. For example, you might think to yourself, “My knee hurts. I’m feeling a little sad. The breeze feels nice.” A good way to find the quality of mindfulness is meditation. Focus on your breathing patterns, try not to think of anything else, and find your center. It's a break away from life that can help you see the bigger picture. If you’re not sure how to start, try a free mindfulness app, such as Insight Timer. The human mind has the fantastic ability to see, hear, and think what it wants – regardless of the reality of the situation. It's important to keep this in mind whenever you find yourself feeling an emotion you'd rather not be feeling. Take a few moments to assess the situation before jumping to conclusions and acting on your emotions.  For example, if someone says something to you in an unfriendly tone of voice or gives you what seems like a dirty look, don’t jump to the conclusion that they dislike you or are angry at you. Sometimes people are unaware of how they look or sound to others. If you have a question about someone else’s feelings or intentions, the best way to clear the air is to ask. For example, you might ask, “What did you mean by that?” or, “Are you upset with me about something?”
Honesty is usually the best policy. It is disrespectful to lie to someone. If you don't want to date someone, you should say so.  Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, "No, thank you, I already have a date for that party." Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, "No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit." Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you "sandwich" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, "You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!" You could also try, "You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, "That sounds fun, but no thank you. I'm not interested in dating you." Don't beat around the bush. If you do not want to accept the date, there is no need to say, "Let me think about it." It is best to get the rejection over with. You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, "I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept." Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly. It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date.
