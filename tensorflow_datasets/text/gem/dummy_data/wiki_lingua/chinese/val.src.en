. Exercising will make you feel more energized, happier, and more physically fit. If you’re feeling sluggish, chances are that working out is the last thing you want to do, but that’s precisely what will make you feel more alert and alive. Just 30 minutes of exercise a day will boost your energy levels overall, not to mention that it will have marked improvements on your health. You can run every other day, take a yoga class a few times a week, join a team sport, or find a workout buddy and hit up the gym.  Try to be active whenever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of driving. Do some sit-ups when you’re watching TV. Work out in the morning. This will wake your body up and will give you more energy throughout the day. Power naps have been proven to wake up your body when you’re feeling a lack of energy. Just close yourself off in a dark room for 15-20 minutes, close your eyes, and let yourself drift off. Even if you don’t end up falling asleep completely, you will gain energy from resting your body. Power naps are superior to real naps; sleeping for over an hour or more will actually make you feel more tired and groggy when you wake up, and can keep you up at night. A good time to take a power nap can be after lunch, when you’re feeling a little tired after eating. Take a few handfuls of cold water and splash it on your face when you’re feeling tired. This is a great trick to wake yourself up in the morning – not to mention make yourself feel cleaner – and also for energizing yourself throughout the day. Just being outside as much as you can has been proven to make people feel happier and more energetic. Getting some fresh air in your lungs can invigorate you and make you feel ready to embrace the day. Stepping outside or onto your balcony right after you wake up and breathing in fresh air just for a minute can make you more energized almost instantly. If you can get some sunlight, make sure to do it; instead of eating lunch at your desk, step out to get some lunch or eat it on a park bench. If you spend eight hours in a row indoors, then you will be drained of your energy much more quickly than if you took breaks and spent some time outside. Walking for just twenty minutes can wake up your mind and body and make you feel more energized. Whenever you feel your energy waning, step outside, get some fresh air, and move your body. . Getting enough sleep is crucial if you want to energize yourself. You may be feeling tired simply because you haven’t been sleeping enough. You may think that enough willpower and caffeine can combat the fact that you’ve been averaging five hours of sleep a night, but nothing can substitute a good night’s sleep. Make sure to sleep for at least 7-8 hours a night and to go to bed around the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning; changing your sleeping schedule regularly can make you feel like you’re waking up with jet lag.  Make sure you have a good winding-down routine at least an hour before sleep. Turn off all visual stimuli, such as your phone, computer, and television, and read quietly in bed or listen to some calming music. This can help you fall asleep faster. When you wake up, stop hitting snooze and start your day. Hitting snooze repeatedly will only make you fall back into a short, jagged sleep, and won’t actually make you feel any more rested. Waking up after you hear your alarm will make you feel more energized and more in control of your day.
