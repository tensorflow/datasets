Lie in the most natural sleeping position you can. Don't hold anything, put your legs on the bed, and don't pick your head up. If you normally sleep on your stomach, do so when fake sleeping. People you know won't find it suspicious. When you are naturally sleeping you will move very little. To give the impression that you are truly asleep it is best not to move. Unless someone is watching you sleep for an extended time period, you won’t be expected to move. Avoid tightly pinching your eyelids together. To give the best impression of sleep, your muscles, including your eyelids, should be relaxed.  Look down as you close your eyes to keep your eyelids from fluttering. Your eyes aren’t always fully closed when sleeping. Let your eyelids droop and close gently; you may still be able to see out of the slit of your eyelids. Take slow, even, deep breaths. You should relax your breathing and try to keep it as even as possible. Count in your head as you breathe in, and then try to breath out for the same amount of time. Repeat this for each breath you take. If you hear a loud noise or are touched, take a short, sudden breath and twitch your body slightly. Even during sleep, our bodies are aware of what is happening around them. Sell your fake sleeping by incorporating what appear to be unconscious reactions to sounds and movements in the room.  After you have reacted to the disturbance, let your body relax and your breathing return to a slow even state. Be sure not to smile or open your eyes, or you will give away that you are actually awake.
