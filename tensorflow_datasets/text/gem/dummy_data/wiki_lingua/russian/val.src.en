There is a wide range of potato varieties to choose from, but they generally fall under five basic categories: first early, second early, early main crop, main crop, and late main crop. Knowing what category your selected potato variety falls under will tell you when to plant and harvest it.  Plant early varieties as early as March or April. They'll take between 75-90 days to mature for harvest. However, if you plant them too early, they could be damaged by frost. Plant mid-season potatoes from May to July. They'll take between 85-110 days to mature for harvest. Mid-season potatoes grow best in warmer climates and temperatures. Plant late season potatoes from July to August. They'll take between 120-135 days to mature for harvest. These potatoes usually tolerate winter temperatures and frost better than early varieties. The entire bottom of the pot should be covered. Lightly pat the soil down with your hands to make sure that it is firmly packed. If the soil is not solid enough, the potatoes will sink to the very bottom of the pot. Both the fiberglass screen and the pebble/stone layer should be fully covered and no longer visible after you add the soil. Use a scoop or spade to lightly sprinkle granular organic fertilizer on top of the first soil layer in the pot. The amount that you use will depend on the type of fertilizer that you buy and the size of your pot. Read the instructions on the fertilizer's package carefully and follow them directly.  Choose a fertilizer that is explicitly for container planting. An organic or vegetable-specific blend is even better. Once your potatoes are established, you'll want to feed them liquid fertilizer as often as every 2 weeks. Again, reference the fertilizer's package for instructions. Space the tubers at least 6 inches (15Â cm) apart. Ensure that they are not touching one another or the edge of the pot. Do not overcrowd each pot by planting more than the recommended amount of seed potatoes.  When the potatoes are in position, press them gently into the soil and fertilizer mix. It's likely that your seed potatoes will have eyes all over their skin, so just position the side with the most eyes facing upwards. Use a spade to gently add more soil into the pot, creating an even layer. When you are finished, your seed potatoes will be completely hidden. Use your hands to gently pat down the soil, being careful not to crush your tubers by pressing too hard. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to add even more growing medium. Use your best judgment and fill it up most of the way, but not all the way to the rim. You will add more soil as the potatoes grow, so account for this as you fill. Use a watering can or hose to slowly add water to the freshly planted pot. Try to cover all of the soil's exposed surface as you are watering. When water starts to flow out of the pot's bottom drainage holes, stop watering.  Potatoes do best with soil that is moist, but not soggy. Water-logged soil can actually lead to the growth of fungus. You can add a layer of straw to the top of your soil to keep it moist and shaded throughout the day.
