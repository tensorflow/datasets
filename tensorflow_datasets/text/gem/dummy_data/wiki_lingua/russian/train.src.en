. Endometriosis is when endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. The tissue may grow around the uterus or even spread to other parts of your abdomen. Painful periods and cramps that last for several days are the main symptom of this condition, but symptoms can also include:  Pain when you have sex. Pain when you have a bowel movement or urinate, especially during your period. Excessive bleeding during your period or between periods. Infertility. Other less serious symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, and fatigue. Adenomyosis is a condition that causes endometrial glands to grow too deeply within the uterine muscular wall. This can lead to an enlarged uterus, painful periods, and other symptoms as well. Some women with adenomyosis have no symptoms, but symptoms may include:  Periods that are heavy or that last a long time. Stabbing pain in your pelvis or severe cramps. Cramps that worsen as you get older. Pain during sex. Blood clots that you pass during your period. Swelling in your abdomen due to an enlarged uterus. . Pelvic inflammatory disease often results from a sexually transmitted disease and it causes an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs. This condition can cause painful cramps. Other symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease may include:  Pelvic pain. Fever. Foul smelling discharge coming from your vagina. Pain and/or bleeding during sex. A burning sensation during urination. Bleeding between your periods. Cervical stenosis is when the opening of the cervix is narrower than is normal. Some women who are past menopause may have cervical stenosis without any symptoms. However, symptoms of cervical stenosis may include:  Not having a period. Having painful periods. Having abnormal bleeding, such as between periods. Infertility. A lump in the pelvic area caused by a bulge in the uterus. Uterine fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the uterine walls. They are often benign and cause no symptoms. However, tumors, cysts, and malformations can also cause secondary dysmenorrhea, which is why it is important to talk to your gynecologist if you have a sudden onset of severe or ongoing menstrual cramps.. If you do have symptoms of uterine fibroids, then some of the symptoms may include:  Bleeding heavily during your period. Having an enlarged abdomen and/or a feeling of fullness in your lower abdomen. Urinating frequently. Experiencing pain during sex. Having pain in your lower back. Having difficulty giving birth or requiring a cesarean section. Being infertile (rare). Intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs can also cause secondary dysmenorrhea. If you have one of these birth control devices and it is causing you severe pain, then talk to your gynecologist. Copper IUDs are more likely to cause severe pain than other types of IUDs.
If you are only mildly potassium deficient, eating potassium-rich foods should balance out your potassium levels. Once you have purchased potassium supplements, only take the prescribed amount--over compensating and taking more than the prescribed amount could lead to diarrhea, stomach irritation, and nausea and may cause muscle weakness, slowed heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythm. Extended-release form tablets are designed so that it will not dissolve in the stomach, but in the intestines. This extended release will help prevent the irritation of gastric lining. Potassium tablets should be taken with one full glass of water. Do not crush or chew potassium tablet as this will affect their extended-release feature. You can purchase potassium powder or liquid that can be mixed with water and then drunk. For the correct dosage, you should follow the instructions provided by your doctor. Generally, powdered and liquid potassium must be completely dissolved in a ½ glass of water. If too much of this powder or liquid is consumed, it could cause gastric irritation. Taking potassium intravenously is strictly intended for extreme cases of potassium depletion and used under strict physician supervision. If you think your potassium levels are dangerously low, talk to your doctor about intravenous potassium. Do not try this on your own. Fast infusion may lead to cardiac irritation causing life threatening irregular cardiac rhythms.
Guinea pigs are social creatures, so if you have more than one, you should avoid separating them when one is dying. Doing so could make both animals anxious or sad, and this is the last thing you want to do as your guinea pig makes his grand exit. It might be a good idea to separate your ailing guinea pig from his friends if he is in pain or the other guinea pig tries to rough-house with him. You will need to make this judgment yourself based on the situation. Placing a small, light-weight blanket or piece of soft cloth on top of or around your guinea pig will keep him from getting cold and will help him relax. Your guinea pig may become incontinent as his bodily systems begin to shut down, so change out the blanket every so often to keep your pet reasonably clean and comfortable.  Many animals (and people) are much more sensitive to cold as they age and begin to die, so keeping your older guinea pig's cage environment slightly warmer than you used to can improve his comfort substantially. Use a material or cloth that your guinea pig is familiar with to enhance his comfort with the situation. A dying guinea pig will become very weak and unable to feed or water himself as his death approaches. You can make his passing less uncomfortable by offering him water from a spoon, syringe, or water bottle. Blend or mix a guinea pig "smoothie" that contains hay, water and ground up pellets and feed it to him.  Don't force your guinea pig to eat or drink if he doesn't want to. You simply want to make these things accessible to him if he can't get them himself. Make sure anything you feed your guinea pig is well-blended so he doesn't have to use up precious energy chewing (which he might not be able to do, anyway). You can gently cuddle or stroke your guinea pig to comfort him and express affection. This will help your guinea pig know that he is not alone and should reduce any fear or anxiety he may be experiencing. If you hold him, do so in a way you know he likes and that won't cause him any unnecessary pain or discomfort.  Many guinea pigs like to have their foreheads gently stroked. If you know your pet enjoys this, do this as he passes away. Take note of any body language or noises your guinea pig may be making and adjust your physical contact with him accordingly; don't do anything that causes your pet pain. Your guinea pig will be most comfortable in warm, quiet space with lighting that is neither too bright nor too dark. Soft, pleasant, natural sounds (such as birds singing or the babbling of a brook) may be comforting to your pet. It may also be best to give him some space toward the end so he can slip away peacefully. Check on him often to offer food and water.  If there is a specific toy or other item you know your guinea pig is fond of, place this object next to him. The simple presence of items he enjoys may provide your pet a sense of calm. Treat your dying guinea pig as you would a sleeping baby; anything that is likely to wake a snoozing infant will probably also be unpleasant for your pet.
