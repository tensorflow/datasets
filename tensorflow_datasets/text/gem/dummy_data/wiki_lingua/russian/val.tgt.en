Create a planting schedule based upon the variety of potato. Fill your pot with 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of your growing medium. Mix in organic fertilizer, as directed on the package. Place your seed potatoes in the soil with the eyes facing upward. Cover your tubers with 6 inches (15 cm) of growing medium. Water the soil in the pot until it begins to drain.
