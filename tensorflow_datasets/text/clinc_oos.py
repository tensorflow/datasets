_DESCRIPTION = """
Task-oriented dialog systems need to know when a query falls outside their range of supported intents, but current text classification corpora only define label sets that cover every example. We introduce a new dataset that includes queries that are out-of-scope (OOS), i.e., queries that do not fall into any of the system's supported intents. This poses a new challenge because models cannot assume that every query at inference time belongs to a system-supported intent class. Our dataset also covers 150 intent classes over 10 domains, capturing the breadth that a production task-oriented agent must handle. It offers a way of more rigorously and realistically benchmarking text classification in task-driven dialog systems.

  """CLINC Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope (OOS) Detection.

  This dataset is for evaluating the performance of intent classification
  systems in the presence of "out-of-scope" queries. By "out-of-scope",
  we mean queries that do not fall into any of the system-supported intent
  classes. Most datasets include only data that is "in-scope".
  Our dataset includes both in-scope and out-of-scope data.

  This version of the CLINC OOS dataset contains 150 "in-scope" intents from
  10 domains. Each intent has 100 train, 20 validation, and 30 test samples.
  There are 100 train and validation out-of-scope samples, and 1000 out-of-scope
  test samples. It also contains labels for intent domain which are not included
  in the original dataset.
