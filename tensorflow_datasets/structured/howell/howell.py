Demographic data from Kalahari !Kung San people collected by Nancy Howell

Howellâ€™s observations of the !Kung San were made by Howell in Botswana between
August 1967 and May 1969. Fuller descriptions of the region and the people
under study can be found in R. B. Lee and I. DeVore (eds), 1976, Kalahari
Hunter-Gatherers: Studies of the !Kung San and Their Neighbors, Harvard
University Press, Cambridge, Mass. And in N. Howell, 2000, Demography of the
Dobe !Kung, Aldine de Gruyter, New York.

Only columns on height, weight, age, and sex were kept. Rows with any
null values were dropped.

Number of instances: 544

Variables:

1. height in cm   (float)
2. weight in kg   (float)
3. age in years   (int)
4. male indicator (int)
