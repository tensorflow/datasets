_DESCRIPTION = """
DART (DAta Record to Text generation) contains RDF entity-relation annotated
with sentence descriptions that cover all facts in the triple set. DART was
constructed using existing datasets such as: WikiTableQuestions, WikiSQL, WebNLG
and Cleaned E2E. The tables from WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL were transformed
to subject-predicate-object triples, and its text annotations were mainly
collected from MTurk. The meaningful representations in E2E were also
transformed to triples and its descriptions were used, some that couldn't be
transformed were dropped.

The dataset splits of E2E and WebNLG are kept, and for the WikiTableQuestions
and WikiSQL the Jaccard similarity is used to keep similar tables in the same
set (train/dev/tes).

This dataset is constructed following a standarized table format.
