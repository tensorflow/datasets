_DESCRIPTION = """
This data was used by Hong and Young to illustrate the power of the optimal discriminant plane even in ill-posed settings. Applying the KNN method in the resulting plane gave 77% accuracy. However, these results are strongly biased (See Hong, Z.Q. and Yang, J.Y. "Optimal Discriminant Plane for a Small Number of Samples and Design Method of Classifier on the Plane",
Pattern Recognition, Vol. 24, No. 4, pp. 317-324, 1991, or email to stefan '@' coral.cs.jcu.edu.au). Results obtained by Aeberhard et al. are :

RDA : 62.5%, KNN 53.1%, Opt. Disc. Plane 59.4%

The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers. The Authors give no information on the individual variables nor on where the data was originally used.

Notes:
- In the original data 4 values for the fifth attribute were -1. These values have been changed to ? (unknown). (*)
- In the original data 1 value for the 39 attribute was 4. This value has been changed to ? (unknown). (*)
