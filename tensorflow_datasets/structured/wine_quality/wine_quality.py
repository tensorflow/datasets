_DESCRIPTION = """
Two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts).
Each expert graded the wine quality
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Several data mining methods were applied to model
these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the
best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),
etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity
analysis procedure).

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables
are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
