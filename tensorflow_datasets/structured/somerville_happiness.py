select the minimal set of attributes preserving or increasing predictability of the data.

Attribute Information:

D = decision attribute (D) with values 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) 
X1 = the availability of information about the city services 
X2 = the cost of housing 
X3 = the overall quality of public schools 
X4 = your trust in the local police 
X5 = the maintenance of streets and sidewalks 
X6 = the availability of social community events 

Attributes X1 to X6 have values 1 to 5.
