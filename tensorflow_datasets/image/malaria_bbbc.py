_DESCRIPTION = """The original data set contains 1364 images and
consists of two classes of uninfected cells(red blood cells and leukocytes) and
four classes of infected cells(gametocytes, rings, schizonts, and trophozoites).
The Malaria dataset contains a total of 74,238 cell images and we have removed 441 cell images
because annotators marked the cells as difficult as it was not clearly in one of the cell classes.
Finally malaria_bbbc data set contains 73,797 cells.
This data set is extremely skewed toward uninfected cases,
so we did not divide original data to train and test sets
so that the user can try in their own way to deal with this problem."""
