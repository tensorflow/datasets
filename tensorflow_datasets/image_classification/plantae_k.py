This dataset contains 2153 images of healthy and unhealthy plant leaves divided
16 categories by species and state of health. The images are in high resolution
JPG format.

Note: Each image is a separate download. Some might rarely fail, therefore make
sure to restart if that happens. An exception will be raised in case one of the
downloads repeatedly fails.
