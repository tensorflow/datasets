_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) is an evolving collection of textural
images in the wild, annotated with a series of human-centric attributes,
inspired by the perceptual properties of textures. This data is made available
to the computer vision community for research purposes.

The "label" of each example is its "key attribute" (see the official website).
The official release of the dataset defines a 10-fold cross-validation
partition. Our TRAIN/TEST/VALIDATION splits are those of the first fold.
