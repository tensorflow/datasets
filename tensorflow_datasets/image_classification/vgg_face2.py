_DESCRIPTION = """\
VGGFace2 is a large-scale face recognition dataset. \
Images are downloaded from Google Image Search and have large variations \
in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession. VGGFace2 contains images \
from identities spanning a wide range of different ethnicities, accents, \
professions and ages. All face images are captured "in the wild", with pose \
and emotion variations and different lighting and occlusion conditions. Face \
distribution for different identities is varied, from 87 to 843, with an \
average of 362 images for each subject.
