_DESCRIPTION = """\
TyDi QA is a question answering dataset covering 11 typologically diverse \
languages with 204K question-answer pairs. The languages of TyDi QA are \
diverse with regard to their typology -- the set of linguistic features that \
each language expresses -- such that we expect models performing well on this \
set to generalize across a large number of the languages in the world. It \
contains language phenomena that would not be found in English-only corpora. \
To provide a realistic information-seeking task and avoid priming effects, \
questions are written by people who want to know the answer, but don't know \
the answer yet, (unlike SQuAD and its descendents) and the data is collected \
directly in each language without the use of translation (unlike MLQA and \
XQuAD).

IMPORTANT:  Please choose your training split carefully.

Training splits:

'train': This is the GoldP task from the original TyDi QA paper \
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05002] that has original-language labeled \
training data.

'translate-train-*': These splits are the automatic translations from English \
to each target language used in the translate-train baselines in the XTREME \
paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11080]. This purposefully ignores the \
non-English TyDiQA-GoldP training data to simulate the transfer learning \
scenario where original-language data is not available and system builders \
must rely on labeled English data plus existing machine translation systems.

Typically, you should use EITHER the train or translate-train split, but not both.
