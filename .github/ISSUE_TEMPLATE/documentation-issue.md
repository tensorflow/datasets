**Description of issue**

Describe what the problem is. Please include URL(s) if possible.

If the issue is trivial to fix (e.g. typo), it may be easier to directly send us a PR without opening an issue first.

Please note our catalog and API are automatically generated from the implementation. For example, if you see a typo in [celeb_a.md](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/celeb_a), modifications have to be done in [`tensorflow_datasets/image/celeba.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/image/celeba.py).
